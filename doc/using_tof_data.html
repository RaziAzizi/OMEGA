%% Using TOF data
%% 
% Preliminary TOF support has been added to OMEGA, for both static and  dynamic 
% data. Both GATE simulated data and measured data can be used.  Below you’ll 
% first find information on how to enable TOF in GATE data  and then how to use 
% measured GATE data.
%% TOF properties
% The following parameters can and need to be set to use TOF data:
% 
% |options.TOF_bins| this variable determines both the  number of TOF bins and 
% also whether TOF data is used at all. Setting it  to 1 will disable the use 
% of TOF data, however, it will not convert TOF  data into non-TOF data (for that 
% see |options.TOF_bins_used| below). This value needs to correspond to the number 
% of TOF bins you have (or want to have when using GATE data).
% 
% |options.TOF_width| this is the width of each TOF time bin (in seconds). Currently 
% each bin needs to have identical lengths.
% 
% |options.TOF_offset| this value specifies possible offset  in the TOF data 
% (in seconds). What this means is that if your TOF bins  are not centered in 
% zero (center of FOV) you can specify the offset  here. Offset is applied to 
% Biograph mCT and Vision data obtained from  the scanner.
% 
% |options.TOF_noise_FWHM| This parameter has two  properties. The first one 
% applies to any TOF data that is saved by OMEGA (GATE, Inveon/Biograph list-mode), 
% the second only to GATE data. The  first use of this parameter is in naming 
% purposes as this value is  included in the filename. If you use Biograph data 
% it is recommended to  set this to the actual time resolution of the scanner 
% although it is not necessary. This variable is ignored if you manually load 
% the  measurement data. The second use of this variable is to add temporal  noise 
% to the GATE data with the specified full width at half maximum  (FWHM, in seconds). 
% For more information on creating GATE TOF data see  the next section.
% 
% |options.TOF_FWHM| the FWHM of the TOF time resolution  used in image reconstruction 
% (in seconds). This variable is used solely  for image reconstruction purposes 
% and as such can be different from the  above |options.TOF_noise_FWHM|. This 
% is the actual time resolution of the device that is used when computing the 
% TOF weighted reconstruction.
% 
% |options.TOF_bins_used| the number of TOF bins used. Currently this value 
% has to either be the same as |options.TOF_bins| or 1. In the latter case the 
% TOF data set is converted (summed) into a  non-TOF data set before the reconstruction. 
% In the future this will  allow TOF mashing.
%% Enabling TOF in GATE data
% TOF data can be enabled simply by adding more TOF bins than 1.
% 
% TOF in GATE data can either be included directly in GATE by setting the (<https://opengate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/digitizer_and_detector_modeling.html#time-resolution 
% temporal resolution module>) or by simply adding the preferred temporal noise 
% in OMEGA. In the first case, you will only be able to use the one temporal resolution 
% that you set in GATE, but in the latter case you will be able to choose any  
% temporal resolution and use the same simulated data to create different  TOF 
% data sets each with different temporal resolution.
% 
% If you are using TOF data with the temporal resolution module, you should 
% set |options.TOF_noise_FWHM = 0| such that no additional noise is included. 
% |options.TOF_FWHM| on the other should be the FWHM of the added temporal noise 
% multiplied with sqrt(2).
% 
% When using GATE data, the actual temporal resolution will most likely differ 
% from the one specified by |options.TOF_noise_FWHM|. If you want to know the 
% actual time resolution with the specified added noise you should run a simulation 
% with a point source. Alternative,  multiplying with sqrt(2) should be relatively 
% accurate in most cases.
%% TOF in other PET data
% Any PET data with TOF can be used. TOF is assumed to be the fourth  dimension 
% of the matrix (potential time steps are assumed to be the  fifth dimension). 
% All values except for |options.TOF_noise_FWHM| need to be filled.
% 
% Biograph mCT and Vision allow for automatic extraction of TOF data.  However, 
% currently only the default number of bins (13 for mCT and 33  for Vision) are 
% available.
%% TOF integration points
% By default, the trapezoidal integration uses 6 points. However, for  small 
% TOF FWHM values this might not be accurate enough for accurate  reconstruction. 
% For implementation 4 this can be modified by changing  the value of |TRAPZ_BINS| 
% in <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/source/projector_functions.h 
% projector_functions.h>. For implementation 2 (OpenCL), modify |TRAPZ_BINS| with 
% the desired number of bins in <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/source/general_opencl_functions.h 
% general_opencl_functions.h>. For CUDA the file is <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/source/general_cuda_functions.cuh 
% general_cuda_functions.cuh>. Implementation 4 requires recompilation before 
% the changes take effect (run |install_mex| again). Implementation 2 does not 
% require anything else except re-running the reconstruction.
