##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
%% Using GATE PET data
% When using GATE data (LMF, ASCII or ROOT) the only  requirements are that 
% any of the options that you have selected are  actually present and that volume 
% IDs have been selected. For example, if you wish to obtain the original source 
% image you need to select all the source coordinates in the coincidence mask 
% and trues require both event IDs as well as scatter numbers. It is also recommended 
% to select the  time stamp for the first single. More information on the necessary  
% variables in the coincidence mask below.
% 
% Data produced through clusters, e.g. files with name1.dat/root,  name2.dat/root, 
% etc. do not need to be combined. Neither is there any  need to adjust the time 
% slice, i.e. it can be the same as the total  duration as time step/slices can 
% be adjusted freely as long as the time  tag is included in the coincidence mask. 
% Having a different time slice  will cause all the data to be combined in the 
% case of static  reconstruction. ALL files present in the folder specified by 
% |options.fpath| will be loaded and included. Different simulations should thus 
% be in different folders.
% 
% OMEGA has been tested mainly with cylindricalPET system, but it does  also 
% work with CPET, ECAT and scanner (OPET is untested, but should also work). ECAT 
% has no restrictions, while cylindricalPET can't include  submodules. Due to 
% the submodules restriction, scanner also can't  include more than one level 
% 3 component. CPET, on the other hand, cannot be used without modifications as 
% it uses continuous detectors. The only way to reconstruct CPET data is to use 
% it in list-mode mode. This means that you need to extract the absorption coordinates 
% (e.g. |[options.coincidences, ~, ~, ~, ~, x, y, z] = load_data(options);|) and 
% then input those coordinates to the |options| struct (e.g. |options.x = x; options.y 
% = y; options.z = z;|). This will enable a list-mode reconstruction. The reconstructed 
% results  may, however, be more unreliable than with other PET systems.  Corrections 
% are not available on CPET systems.
% 
% Coincidences are loaded from files including string "Coincidences"  (ASCII) 
% or from tree named Coincidences (ROOT). Delays are loaded  similarly ("delay" 
% and delay tree).
% 
% ASCII or ROOT formats are recommended. If you wish to easily view the GATE 
% data in matrix form, ASCII is the recommended format. If you wish  to use ROOT 
% format, you can control the data saved with the coincidence  mask just as with 
% ASCII or binary (unsupported) data (undocumented in  GATE), this also means 
% that the coincidence mask of ASCII affects ROOT  data as well.
%% Coincidence mask
% As mentioned above, the base requirement is that volume IDs are present for 
% both singles (no submodules).
% 
% In order to have any control on the time properties/dynamics, the  first single 
% should have its time stamp included. The time stamp is  recommended in all cases, 
% however. No tests have so far been performed  in cases where no time stamps 
% were selected. Time stamp for the second  single is not necessary at the moment.
% 
% In order to store the original/true decay image, XYZ position of the  source 
% in world referential has to be selected for both singles.
% 
% Locations of the photon absorption points in the detectors can be  obtained 
% if XYZ position in the world referential is included for both  singles.
% 
% Trues and scatter require event IDs as well as number of Compton and  Rayleigh 
% scatter events for both singles. Randoms require only the event IDs. For more 
% information on storing trues, scatter and randoms see <extract_GATE_data.html 
% here>.
