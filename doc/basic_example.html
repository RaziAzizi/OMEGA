##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
%% Basic example
%% Set up
% The most important part of OMEGA is the Scanner properties section. This has 
% already been filled for the example case, but here are detailed explanations 
% as to where the values are derived from.
% 
% *Blocks per ring*
% 
% In the GATE macro <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/exampleGATE/camera.mac#L64 
% |camera.mac|> this is found from line 64. I.e. it is the ring/R-sector repeater. 
% The R-sector in this case contains all the blocks/buckets in the axial direction 
% and is repeated radially along the ring. Inside these R-sectors are the modules 
% that are the individual blocks/buckets.
% 
% For non-GATE data, this should be the number of blocks/buckets the scanner 
% has transaxially. This multiplied with the below crystals per block should equal 
% the total number of detectors on one ring (transaxially).
% 
% *Linear multiply*
% 
% This is the axial repetition factor, from line 59 in <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/exampleGATE/camera.mac#L59 
% |camera.mac|>. Each module (block/bucket) is repeated this many times in the 
% axial direction. The blocks have small gaps between them in the example data 
% (0.2 mm).
% 
% For non-GATE data this should be the number of blocks/buckets axially. This 
% multiplied with the below crystals per block should equal the number of crystal 
% rings (e.g. the number of crystals along a line axially).
% 
% *Transaxial multiplier*
% 
% Basically same as above, but for transaxial case. In the example case it is 
% simply 1. However, in certain cases there can be transaxial repeaters and in 
% such case you should set that value here.
% 
% *Crystals per block, transaxial*
% 
% This is simply the number of crystals/detectors in the module/block/bucket 
% transaxially. Line 53 in <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/exampleGATE/camera.mac#L53 
% camera.mac>.
% 
% If you have a block with 20x10 crystals, set crystals per block to 20.
% 
% *Crystals per block, axial*
% 
% This is the axial crystals per block. In the example case it is the same as 
% the transaxial one.
% 
% If you have a block with 20x10 crystals, set axial crystals per block to 10.
% 
% *Crystal pitch*
% 
% Both the transaxial (x- and y-direction) as well as the axial (z-direction) 
% crystal pitches need to be input. These are the distances between the centers 
% of adjacent crystals in the same block. Line 55 in <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/exampleGATE/camera.mac#L55 
% |camera.mac|>. There are small gaps between the crystals.
% 
% *Ring diameter*
% 
% This is the total diameter of the scanner bore, i.e. the distance between 
% perpendicular detectors. Usually this should be the Rmin, see line 6 in <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/exampleGATE/camera.mac#L6 
% |camera.mac|>.
% 
% *Transaxial FOV*
% 
% This is the length of a one side of the transaxial FOV (needs to be rectangular). 
% Both x- and y-directions can be selected individually, though square FOVs are 
% recommended. This parameter can be selected freely, but the current value was 
% selected such that the size is of similar size as that in the Inveon PET scanner 
% (which uses the vendor specified FOV size).
% 
% *Axial FOV*
% 
% Same as above, but for axial (z) direction. Has been selected to be slightly 
% smaller than the actual scanner length.
% 
% *Machine name*
% 
% Simply the name for your scanner. Used only to name the saved mat-files.
%% Loading GATE data
% *GATE specific settings*
% 
% Before loading GATE data, you should specify first if you want to load some 
% GATE specific data. These include trues, scatter, randoms and the source image. 
% For more detailed information on extracting GATE trues, scatter and randoms 
% see <extract_GATE_data.html Extracting GATE scatter, randoms and trues data>.
% 
% By default, the main-file saves trues, scatter, randoms and the source images. 
% These can be, respectively, disabled by setting the values on lines <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L80 
% 80>, <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L94 94>, 
% <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L121 121> and 
% <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L132 132> to 
% false. Optionally, the trues or scatter can be reconstructed instead of prompts. 
% For trues this is achieved by setting line <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L87 
% 87> to true, and for scatter line <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L113 
% 113>.
% 
% *GATE input data setup*
% 
% Three GATE input data are supported: ASCII, LMF and ROOT. Of these ASCII is 
% used by default (line <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L148 
% 148>). The coincidence mask is correct if no modifications have been made. The 
% numbers come straight from the ASCII mask order as specified by GATE (see GATE 
% <https://opengate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_output_management.html#coincidences-files-gatecoincidences-dat-bin 
% documentation>).
% 
% LMF data can be enabled on line <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L168 
% 168>. For LMF data you need to specify the number of bits dedicated for each 
% geometric element (R-sectors, modules, submodules, crystals, layers). This is 
% output by GATE at the start of the simulation, see the image below:
% 
% Furthermore, you need the coincidence window length as well the "clock time 
% step" that can be found from the output cch-files.
% 
% ROOT data is enabled from line <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L216 
% 216> and doesn’t need any specific information. ROOT data is, however, unstable 
% on MATLAB R2018b and earlier and is not supported on Windows. See <known_issues.html 
% Known issues and limitations> for more information.
%% Image settings
% The voxel counts for each slice and the slice count can be specified on lines 
% <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L236 236-242>. 
% Slice count is usually the number of crystal rings x 2 - 1.
% 
% Depending on how the system is built, you might need to rotate it or flip 
% it in order for the reconstructed images to be correctly oriented (see lines 
% <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L245 245> and 
% <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L252 252>). 
% This is not necessary for the example case though.
%% Sinogram settings
% Span factor (line <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L269 
% 269>) determines the axial compression, that is how many sinograms are combined 
% in the axial direction. Currently 3 is the smallest span factor supported (if 
% you wish to use span of 1, use raw data). Higher span values compress the sinogram 
% data more and result in faster reconstruction, but can have a negative impact 
% on the image quality.
% 
% Ring difference is related to the span value and can be at most the number 
% of crystal rings - 1. Oblique sinograms are created from the ring distance specified 
% by the ring difference. I.e. with maximum ring difference the coincidences between 
% the first and last crystal ring are included. For more information on span and 
% ring difference see <http://tech.snmjournals.org/content/30/2/39.long Data Acquisition 
% in PET Imaging>.

% The number of angular positions (views) is the first dimension of a single 
% sinogram slice (usually depicted with an _s_). Primarily you should use the 
% same value as the device you are modelling, but if that is not available you 
% can use the function |ndist_max| to determine optimal values. This function 
% outputs the orthogonal distance of every line of response as well as displays 
% the view counts for the case of fully encompassing the FOV (i.e. a circle with 
% the FOV square inside) or for a case where the sinogram FOV is fully inside 
% the FOV (i.e. a circle that just fits inside the FOV square). It is recommended 
% the value is set somewhere between these two values.
% 
% The number of angles (tangential positions) determine the second dimension 
% of a single sinogram slice (usually depicted with a _φ_). This should be the 
% number of detectors on a ring divided by two. Smaller values are supported, 
% but they need to be values that are obtained from the number of detectors on 
% a ring divided by a value divisible by two. Smaller values than the number of 
% detectors per ring divided by two will be considered as sinogram mashing (e.g. 
% number of detectors per ring divided by four).
%% Input data
% On Windows, specify the folder for the GATE data on line <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L308 
% 308>. On other systems on line <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L310 
% 310>.
%% Other options
% The name (line <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L301 
% 301>) is used for naming purposes only. I.e. sinograms are saved for specific 
% examination and scanner.
% 
% Only sinograms can be computed by setting line <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L316 
% 316> to true and running the file. This loads the GATE data and then forms the 
% sinograms but does not continue to image reconstruction.
% 
% Likewise, only reconstruction can be enabled on line <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L323 
% 323>. Running with this true, will skip the data load and sinogram formation 
% steps. Previously created measurement data will be automatically loaded if such 
% exists (name and machine name match).
% 
% Status messages can be turned off by setting line <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L328 
% 328> variable to false.
%% Reconstruction options
% The number of iterations and subsets can be selected in Reconstruction properties 
% (lines <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L355 
% 355> and <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L358 
% 358>). These are case specific and have not been optimized for this example.
% 
% It is also possible to enable PSF (line <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L349 
% 349>) and specify its size (line <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L352 
% 352>). By default, the PSF has been enabled.
%% Scaling the data
% By default, the reconstruced images contain the total number of detected counts. 
% This can be converted to Bq/mL with the |scaleImages| function (line <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_main_simple.m#L441 
% 441>), but you have to provide the total time of the measurement. |options.dx/dy/dz| 
% are automatically computed.
%% Export data
% If you want to export the reconstructed image, you can use <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#saveimagem 
% saveImage> function. For example, you can export the reconstructed image as 
% NIfTI format with the following command |saveImage(f_osem, 'nifti', [], options)|.
