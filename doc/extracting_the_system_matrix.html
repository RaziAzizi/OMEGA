%% Extracting the system matrix
% This page details how you can extract only the system matrix (or a subset 
% of it) and use it manually in your own algorithms/code.
% 
% When extracting the system matrix, it is recommended to use main_PET.m and 
% follow its general workflow. This means that you should input the necessary 
% parameters to the initial section (machine properties, sinogram/raw data properties, 
% etc.). It is also recommended to set |options.only_system_matrix = true|. Precompute 
% step should be computed if you have set |options.precompute_lor = true|. The 
% reconstruction step (|reconstructions_main|) should be ignored.
% 
% After the reconstruction step, there is a specific section for the system 
% matrix creation and (optionally) to separately compute any selected algorithms. 
% It is important to run the |custom_prior_prepass| phase before the system matrix 
% is created.
% 
% The subset of the system matrix can then be obtained with |A = observation_matrix_formation(options, 
% current_subset)| or the entire system matrix with |A = observation_matrix_formation(options)|. 
% This matrix behaves as any other (sparse) matrix in MATLAB/Octave. Any selected 
% corrections (attenuation, normalization, scatter) are applied to the system 
% matrix automatically.
% 
% Sinses implementation 1, it is HIGHLY recommended to set |options.precompute_lor 
% = true|. Furthermore, other projectors than improved Siddon are not recommended. 
% PSF blurring needs to be added manually, though you can use PSFKernel function 
% to obtain the Gaussian convolution kernel.
