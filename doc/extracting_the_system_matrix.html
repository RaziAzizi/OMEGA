%% Extracting the system matrix
% Currently there are two ways to extract the system matrix. A class  based 
% method using similar methods as when computing the  forward/backward projections 
% or a function-based method that has been  included since the first release. 
% Currently the class based method is  recommended. For CT data, only the class 
% based method is supported. For  more information on extracting the system matrix 
% in CT, see bottom of page <compute_forward_backwards_projections.html Computing 
% the forward and/or backward projections>.
%% Class based example
% This is based on <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/forward_backward_projections_example.m 
% |forward_backward_projections_example.m|> for PET and e.g. for CT. The initial 
% part shows how to compute the  forward and backward projections, but "System 
% matrix (OSEM) example"  shows how to extract the system matrix (or a subset 
% of it) by using the  same class. First you need to build the class object with 
% e.g. |forwardBackwardProject(options)| for PET and |forwardBackwardProjectCT(options)| 
% for CT and then you can obtain the system matrix simply with |formMatrix(A)| 
% or a subset of it with |formMatrix(A, subsetNumber)|. Note that if you are using 
% precomputed data (|options.precompute_lor = true|) then this is the TRANSPOSE 
% of the system matrix. For CT data,  precomputed data is always used so the matrix 
% is always a transpose of  the system matrix.
%% Function based example
% When extracting the system matrix with the function based method, it is recommended 
% to use <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/main_PET.m |main_PET.m|> 
% and follow its general workflow. This means that you should input the  necessary 
% parameters to the initial section (scanner properties,  sinogram/raw data properties, 
% etc.). It is also recommended to set |options.only_system_matrix = true|. Precompute 
% step should be computed if you have set |options.precompute_lor = true|. The 
% reconstruction step (|reconstructions_main|) should be ignored. CT data does 
% not have a similar example, but should nevertheless work similarly.
% 
% After the reconstruction step, there is a specific section for the  system 
% matrix creation and (optionally) to separately compute any  selected algorithms. 
% It is important to run the |custom_prior_prepass| phase before the system matrix 
% is created.
% 
% The subset of the system matrix can then be obtained with |A = observation_matrix_formation(options, 
% subsetNumber)| or the entire system matrix with |A = observation_matrix_formation(options)|. 
% This matrix behaves as any other (sparse) matrix in MATLAB/Octave. Any  selected 
% corrections (attenuation, normalization, scatter) are applied  to the system 
% matrix automatically.
% 
% Since the system matrix creation uses implementation 1, it is HIGHLY recommended 
% to set |options.precompute_lor = true|. Furthermore, other projectors than improved 
% Siddon are not recommended. PSF blurring needs to be added manually, though 
% you can use |PSFKernel| function to obtain the Gaussian convolution kernel.
