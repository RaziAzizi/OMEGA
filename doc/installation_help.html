%% Installation help
%% Windows
% This section specifies the necessary installation information when using OMEGA 
% on Windows.
% MATLAB
% Simply download and install MATLAB for Windows. Any version from 2009b and 
% up should work, but the latest version is always recommended. If you are using 
% an older version, however, you should use 64-bit version as 32-bit version is 
% not supported.
% 
% Image processing toolbox and parallel computing toolbox are used for some 
% specific features. However, (slower) fallback alternatives are used if these 
% toolboxes are not found in most cases. The only function that requires image 
% processing toolbox is the anisotropic diffusion MRP prior when using either 
% implementation 1 or 4. Due to this, it does not work on Octave. A warning is 
% produced if AD-MRP prior is used without the toolbox.
% Octave
% Simply download the <https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html#ms-windows 
% binary installer for Octave> and install the software (Windows-64, though the 
% large data version should work as well). io and statistics packages are required 
% for some features, but are easy to install with the following commands in the 
% Octave user interface: 
% 
% |pkg install -forge io|
% 
% |pkg install -forge statistics|
% 
% after which you need to load the statistics package
% 
% |pkg load statistics|
% 
% Anisotropic diffusion MRP prior when using either implementation 1 or 4 does 
% not work on Octave. A warning is produced if AD-MRP prior is used.
% C++ Compiler
% You need a C++11 compiler to compile the necessary MEX-files on MATLAB. For 
% a list of supported compilers for each version of MATLAB, see <https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/previous-releases.html 
% here>. On Octave the built-in compiler is sufficient.
% 
% On MATLAB, however, <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/ Visual 
% Studio> is highly recommended. Depending on your MATLAB version, you might need 
% an <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/ older version>. To 
% configure the C++ MEX-compiler you can use the command |mex -setup C++| which 
% will show the currently selected compiler, list all available compilers and 
% show the necessary commands to switch the compiler. 
% 
% MATLAB allows the use of <https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52848-matlab-support-for-mingw-w64-c-c-compiler 
% MinGW++>, but when using this compiler ArrayFire (implementation 2) will not 
% work unless ArrayFire is built from the source with MinGW.
% OpenCL
% If you have a Nvidia GPU, then <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads 
% CUDA toolkit> is recommended. Both Development and Runtime libraries are required, 
% especially if CUDA support is desired.
% 
% If you have Intel GPU/CPU, you should use the <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/opencl-sdk.html 
% Intel OpenCL SDK>. When using a CPU you might need to install the <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/opencl-drivers.html 
% runtimes> as well. 
% 
% If you are using AMD GPUs, it is recommended to download and install <https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/OCL-SDK/releases 
% OCL-SDK>. Additionally, you should install official <https://www.amd.com/en/support 
% drivers>.
% 
% For AMD CPUs you should first install the <https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/OCL-SDK/releases 
% OCL-SDK> and then either the Intel CPU runtimes from above or build <https://github.com/pocl/pocl/blob/master/README.Windows 
% POCL> on Windows (<http://portablecl.org/download.html download>). If you are 
% using a newer version of Visual Studio, you need to do some modification to 
% the POCL Windows script (<https://github.com/pocl/pocl/blob/master/windows/setup_and_build_win64.sh 
% setup_and_build_win64.sh>). For Visual Studio 2019 you need to change the following 
% sections on lines 29 and 38 |"Visual Studio 12 Win64"| to |"Visual Studio 16" 
% -A x64|. For older Visual Studios, simply replace the number 12 with the version 
% you are using (see e.g. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio#History 
% Wikipedia>).
% ArrayFire
% You should install the <https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=48145 
% Visual Studio 2015 (x64) runtime libraries> first.
% 
% On Windows simply download the Windows binary from <https://arrayfire.com/download/ 
% ArrayFire> and install it. For more help on installing ArrayFire on Windows 
% see <http://arrayfire.org/docs/installing.htm#Windows here>.
% 
% The above, however, only works when using MATLAB. If you wish to use ArrayFire 
% on Octave, you need to download the ArrayFire <https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/archive/master.zip 
% source> and manually build it with <http://mingw-w64.org/ MinGW-w64>. That, 
% however, is rather difficult as the CMake files assume Visual Studio and you 
% have to manually edit them accordingly.
% OMEGA
% Download either a release version from <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/releases 
% releases>, clone the current master with e.g. <https://desktop.github.com/ GitHub 
% desktop> or download an archive of the <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/archive/master.zip 
% master-branch>. If you downloaded either a release or master branch archive, 
% you need  to extract the contents to the folder of your choosing. Alternatively,  
% if you are using MATLAB, you can download the mltbx package (|OMEGA.-.Open-source.MATLAB.emission.tomography.software.mltbx|) 
% from the <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/releases releases> and simply run 
% it in which case all the necessary folders will be automatically added to the 
% MATLAB path.
% 
% Unless the MATLAB package was used, you need to add the source and mat-files 
% folders to the MATLAB/Octave path (biograph-folder should be added if you intend 
% to use mCT or Vision list-mode data files). In MATLAB you can do this by simply 
% right clicking the folders and selecting "Add to path → Selected folders" by 
% selecting the OMEGA folder itself and selecting "Add to path → Selected folders 
% and subfolders". Alternatively, if you are using for example Octave, you can 
% add the paths with |addpath('C:\path\to\OMEGA\source')| and |addpath('C:\path\to\OMEGA\mat-files')| 
% or simply with |addpath(genpath('C:\path\to\OMEGA\'))|. On MATLAB you can also 
% add these folders to the list of folders in "Set path".
% 
% To build all the necessary mex-files, simply run |install_mex|.
% 
% In case you have trouble compiling the mex-files, you can also try using the 
% precompiled files on the <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/releases releases> 
% page (MATLAB only).
%% Linux
% This section specifies the necessary installation information when using OMEGA 
% on Linux distributions.
% MATLAB
% Simply download and install MATLAB for Linux. Any version from 2009b and up 
% should work, but the latest version is always recommended. If you are using 
% an older version, however, you should use 64-bit version as 32-bit version is 
% not supported.
% 
% Image processing toolbox and parallel computing toolbox are used for some 
% specific features. However, (slower) fallback alternatives are used if these 
% toolboxes are not found in most cases. The only function that requires image 
% processing toolbox is the anisotropic diffusion MRP prior when using either 
% implementation 1 or 4. Due to this, it does not work on Octave. A warning is 
% produced if AD-MRP prior is used without the toolbox.
% Octave
% There are several different ways to install Octave on Linux systems. For instructions 
% on how to install Octave on variety of Linux distributions see the <https://wiki.octave.org/Category:Installation 
% Octave wiki>. You also need to install the Octave development files (e.g. |liboctave-dev| 
% on Debian/Ubuntu). Alternatively, you can use <https://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_GNU/Linux#Distribution_independent 
% distribution independent> methods or just <https://wiki.octave.org/Building 
% build from source>.
% 
% io and statistics packages are required for some features, but are easy to 
% install with the following commands in the Octave user interface: 
% 
% |pkg install -forge io|
% 
% |pkg install -forge statistics|
% 
% after which you need to load the statistics package
% 
% |pkg load statistics|
% 
% Anisotropic diffusion MRP prior when using either implementation 1 or 4 does 
% not work on Octave. A warning is produced if AD-MRP prior is used.
% C++ Compiler
% A C++ compiler should already be included, but GCC/G++ is recommended. Any 
% version 4.7 or up should be sufficient. It is recommended to use the G++ version 
% supported by your MATLAB version whenever possible, though newer versions should 
% work almost all the time. The only exception is MATLAB R2017b and earlier using 
% G++ 5.1 or newer, as that will most likely lead to errors. See <internal:H_4C84FF51 
% OMEGA section> below for more details. List of supported compilers is available 
% <https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/previous-releases.html here>.
% 
% Octave should be fine in all cases.
% OpenCL
% If you are using any GPU on Linux, it should be sufficient to simply download 
% the OpenCL libraries and headers
% 
% Debian/Ubuntu: |sudo apt-get install ocl-icd-opencl-dev opencl-headers ocl-icd-libopencl1|
% 
% as well as the official drivers.
% 
% Alternatively, if you have a Nvidia GPU, then <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads 
% CUDA toolkit> can be used. Both Development and Runtime libraries are required, 
% especially if CUDA support is desired.
% 
% AMD GPUs should work with only the drivers. If that doesn’t work, you can 
% try using <https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm-OpenCL-Runtime/tree/roc-3.3.0 
% ROCm OpenCL runtimes>.
% 
% If you have Intel GPU/CPU, you can use the <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/opencl-sdk.html 
% Intel OpenCL SDK>. When using a CPU you might need to install the <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/opencl-drivers.html 
% runtimes> as well. The runtimes, however, might not anymore support your current 
% OS version.
% 
% Alternatively, and especially when using AMD CPUs, <http://portablecl.org/docs/html/install.html 
% POCL> is recommended (<http://portablecl.org/download.html download>). Note 
% that if you use the default installation path, you need to move |/usr/local/etc/OpenCL/vendors/pocl.icd| 
% to |/etc/OpenCL/vendors/|.
% 
% A useful, but not necessary, program is <https://github.com/Oblomov/clinfo 
% clinfo> that should be available as a package (e.g. |sudo apt-get install clinfo|). 
% clinfo displays all the available OpenCL platforms, the devices available and 
% various other features. A short list of OpenCL platforms and devices can be 
% obtained in OMEGA with the |OpenCL_device_info()| function.
% ArrayFire
% Simply download the Linux binary from <https://arrayfire.com/download/ ArrayFire> 
% and install it. For more help on installing ArrayFire on Linux see <http://arrayfire.org/docs/installing.htm#Linux 
% here>. Note, however, that, if you are using the official binary, you should 
% install it to the default location in |/opt| and secondly that you should rename, 
% or simply delete if you are not using ArrayFire’s graphic features (not used 
% in OMEGA), all the |libforge| files in |/opt/arrayfire/lib64| to something else 
% (e.g. |libforge.so.old|). Alternatively, you can use a "<http://arrayfire.s3.amazonaws.com/3.6.2/ArrayFire-no-gl-v3.6.2_Linux_x86_64.sh 
% no-GL>" version, but it is an older version that should, nevertheless, work. 
% Leaving the |libforge.so| files with their original names will most likely lead 
% to crashes as of AF 3.7.2 and earlier (except the no-gl versions).
% 
% Alternatively, you can <https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/wiki/Build-Instructions-for-Linux 
% build from source>. If you are building ArrayFire from source, it is recommended 
% to disable Forge (set |AF_BUILD_FORGE| to |OFF|), otherwise you might get unstable 
% behavior.
% OMEGA
% Download either a release version from <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/releases 
% releases>, clone the current master with e.g. |git clone |<https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA.git 
% |https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA.git|> or download an archive of the <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/archive/master.zip 
% master-branch>. If you downloaded either a release or master branch archive, 
% you need  to extract the contents to the folder of your choosing. Alternatively,  
% if you are using MATLAB, you can download the mltbx package (|OMEGA.-.Open-source.MATLAB.emission.tomography.software.mltbx|) 
% from the <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/releases releases> and simply run 
% it in which case all the necessary folders will be automatically added to the 
% MATLAB path.
% 
% Unless the MATLAB package was used, you need to add the source and mat-files 
% folders to the MATLAB/Octave path (biograph-folder should be added if you intend 
% to use mCT or Vision list-mode data files). In MATLAB you can do this by simply 
% right clicking the folders and selecting "Add to path → Selected folders" by 
% selecting the OMEGA folder itself and selecting "Add to path → Selected folders 
% and subfolders". Alternatively, if you are using for example Octave, you can 
% add the paths with |addpath('/path/to/OMEGA/source')| and |addpath('/path/to/OMEGA/mat-files')| 
% or simply with |addpath(genpath('/path/to/OMEGA/'))|. On MATLAB you can also 
% add these folders to the list of folders in "Set path".
% 
% To build all the necessary mex-files, simply run |install_mex|.
% 
% In case you have trouble compiling the mex-files, you can also try using the 
% precompiled files on the <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/releases releases> 
% page (MATLAB only).
% 
% If you are using MATLAB R2017b or EARLIER, you will most likely encounter 
% problems when running the mex-files. You can try one of solutions presented 
% <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/329796-issue-with-libstdc-so-6 
% here>. In short there are mainly two possibilities:
% 
% 1) Locate the system version of libstdc++.so.6 and create an alias in .bashrc 
% for MATLAB to use this one, for example: |alias matlab='LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 
% /path/to/MATLAB/bin/matlab -desktop'|. Or simply run MATLAB with the same |LD_PRELOAD|.
% 
% 2) Rename the libstdc++.so.6 file that ships with MATLAB, located in |/path/to/MATLAB/sys/os/glnxa64/|e.g. 
% |sudo mv /path/to/MATLAB/sys/os/glnxa64/libstdc++.so.6 /path/to/MATLAB/sys/os/glnxa64/libstdc++.so.6.old|
%% Mac

% If you wish to use NIfTI data or save data as NIfTI format, on MATLAB you’ll 
% need EITHER image processing toolbox OR <https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image 
% Tools for NIfTI and ANALYZE image>. For Octave, only Tools for NIfTI and ANALYZE 
% image can be used, though it hasn’t been tested.
% 
% For Analyze data, you’ll need the above <https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image 
% Tools for NIfTI and ANALYZE image> in all cases.
% 
% For DICOM data, you’ll need image processing toolbox on MATLAB and <https://octave.sourceforge.io/dicom/index.html 
% dicom package> on Octave (untested).
% 
% For 3D volumetric visualization, there is built-in support for <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22940-vol3d-v2 
% vol3d> in <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/visualize_pet.m#L344 
% visualize_pet.m>.
% 
% For random subset sampling (|subset_type = 3|), it is recommended to use <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27076-shuffle 
% Shuffle> as it is both faster and more memory efficient than the built-in function. 
% Note that you need to enable this by setting |options.shuffle = true| in MISC 
% SETTINGS in RECONSTRUCTION PROPERTIES.
% 
% If you NEED to use implementation 1 WITHOUT precomputation (not  recommended), 
% then for Octave and MATLAB R2019b and EARLIER, it is  recommended to download 
% and build <https://github.com/stefanengblom/stenglib fsparse>. Note that you 
% need to enable this by setting |options.fsparse = true| in MISC SETTINGS in 
% RECONSTRUCTION PROPERTIES.
