%% Adding custom built-in algorithms
%% 
% This page outlines how to add new algorithms to OMEGA as *built-in algorithms*. 
% Note that performance wise you’ll most likely get only small (or no) benefits 
% when using implementations 1 or 4. The greatest benefit is achieved when using 
% implementation 2. However, implementation 2 is also the hardest one to add new 
% algorithms to.
% 
% Currently, when using implementations 2 or 4, the backward projection is computed 
% for |A' (y / x)| case where |y| are the measurements and |x| the forward projection 
% (in CT this is |exp(-x) / y|). If an algorithm does not follow this pattern, 
% then more modifications are needed. It is, nevertheless, possible to add built-in 
% algorithms even if they do not follow aforementioned pattern.
%% Preliminary steps
% First, edit |recNames.m| and add the name of the variable to list. For subset 
% MAP algorithms, add the name to the (end of) |varMAP| list. MLEM-type (non subset-based) 
% MAP algorithms should be placed after OSL_MLEM with the |nMAPMLEM| incremented 
% by the number of new MLEM-type MAP algorithms. For MLEM type algorithms (non-MAP), 
% add it to |varML| (after |'mlem'|). For OSEM type (non-MAP) algorithms, add 
% it to |OS| (preferably to the end). For MAP algorithms, the name of the regularization 
% parameter needs to be the same as the MAP name, for example if the MAP name 
% is BSREM then, for MRP, the beta value should be named |options.beta_BSREM_MRP|.
% 
% For example, if you would want to add BSREM as a new algorithm you’d add it 
% to the end of |varMAP| variable, e.g. |varMAP = {'OSL_MLEM',…​,'PKMA','BSREM'};|. 
% If you’d want to add, for example, paraboloidal surrogates algorithm without 
% use of any subsets, you’d add it after |'OSL_MLEM'|: |varMAP = {'OSL_MLEM','PS',…​,'PKMA'};|, 
% where |'PS'| is the name for the algorithm. In this case, |nMAPMLEM = 2;|. For 
% non-MAP algorithms (i.e. algorithms that do not use priors), the procedure is 
% similar, but instead of |varMAP|, the |OS| variable is used for subsets-based 
% algorithms and |varMLEM| (|nMLEM|) for MLEM-type non subset-based algorithms.
% 
% New priors should be placed BEFORE |'custom'|, i.e. |'custom'| should always 
% be the last one in the prior list in |recNames.m|. Failing to do that will cause 
% the custom prior reconstruction to stop working properly when using implementation 
% 2.
% 
% Add possible prepass steps to |prepass_phase.m|. This mostly applies to priors 
% (such as computing weights). It is recommended to save any needed variables 
% to the |options| struct, though that is not explicitly required. If the |options| 
% struct is used, then use of any added variables will be much easier and does 
% not require the addition of additional input variables to the current functions.
% 
% If the algorithm uses sensitivity image that is computed without the use of 
% subsets (e.g. as in MBSREM, where the one global sensitivity image is divided 
% by the number of subsets), then you should include it to the list in |prepass_phase.m| 
% (this applies ONLY to implementation 1). Furthermore, you should add it to the 
% list computing the PSF after the prepass phase in |reconstructions_main.m|. 
% If you need MBSREM-style sensitivity image divided by the number of subsets, 
% it is recommended to use |options.pj3|.
%% Implementation 1 specific steps
% These steps are necessary only for implementation 1. Note that only subset-based 
% algorithms are supported.
% 
% Modify |computeEstimatesImp1.m| and your algorithm/prior to the list. For 
% non-MAP methods, add the algorithm preferably after ACOSEM. For MAP/prior-based 
% algorithms, add the algorithm along with OSL-OSEM, BSREM, etc. using the same 
% style as the current algorithms, i.e. the estimate should be computed with and 
% to |im_vectors.([varPrior{ll} '_' varapu{kk}])|. For priors, add the prior to 
% the list of priors before the MAP-algorithms. |grad| should be output of the 
% prior gradient. If you need to use prior types that do not rely on simple gradients 
% (such as proper use of TV), you need to make more significant modifications. 
% This will also mean that the current algorithms most likely cannot support that 
% prior. In such a case, it is probably best to add it in the list of non-MAP/prior 
% based algorithms and have the prior built into the algorithm.
% 
% You also need to modify |init_nex_iter.m| if one of the following applies: 
% - Your algorithm is non-MAP/does not use a prior. - Your algorithm is MAP/prior-based, 
% but the prior information is applied after all subiterations are complete (as 
% in e.g. BSREM). - You are adding a new prior gradient and want it to work with 
% BSREM and/or ROSEM-MAP.
% 
% For the first case, add your algorithm after ACOSEM following the same style 
% as previous algorithms. For the second case, add the MAP-phase as in BSREM and 
% ROSEM-MAP cases. For the third and last case, add your prior to the list of 
% other priors just as in |computeEstimatesImp1.m|.
%% Implementation 4 specific steps
% These steps are necessary only for implementation 4.
% 
% For subsets-based algorithms, modify |computeEstimatesImp4.m| and your algorithm/prior 
% to the list. Priors are first, followed by the reconstruction algorithms. The 
% order does not matter. The algorithm input and output should be, however, always 
% to |im_vectors.OSEM_apu|.
% 
% If your algorithm requires a prepass phase (e.g. computing the full sensitivity 
% image), you need to add the required steps in the prepass phase section before 
% |computeEstimatesImp4.m| in |reconstructions_main.m| (|prepass_phase.m| is only 
% used for priors in implementation 4).
% 
% You also need to modify |computeEstimatesImp4Iter.m| if any of the following 
% applies: - Your algorithm does not use subsets. - Your algorithm is MAP/prior-based, 
% but the prior information is applied after all subiterations are complete (as 
% in e.g. BSREM). - You are adding a new prior gradient and want it to work with 
% BSREM, ROSEM-MAP and OSL-MLEM.
% 
% For the first case, add your algorithm to the |~osem| section (around line 
% 95). The first if-section should be used for MAP/prior algorithms and the second 
% for non-prior ones. Uncomment the commented sections and add corresponding sections 
% for your own algorithm. For the second case, add the MAP-phase as in BSREM and 
% ROSEM-MAP cases. For the third and last case, add your prior to the list of 
% other priors just as in |computeEstimatesImp4.m|.
%% Implementation 2 specific steps
% These steps are necessary only for implementation 2. Adding new built-in algorithms 
% is more difficult for implementation 2 than for 1 or 4. Note that this page 
% only outlines how to add new algorithms to the OpenCL backend. The process for 
% CUDA is practically identical though.
% 
% First you should add the new algorithm to the |RecMethods| struct in |functions.hpp|, 
% to |RecMethodsOpenCL| in |AF_opencl_functions.hpp| and to |RecMethodsOpenCL| 
% in |general_opencl_functions.h|. For the latter two, it is important to maintain 
% the same order in both structures. Add non-MAP/prior algorithms to the first 
% row, priors to the second and MAP/prior algorithms to the third. Then add a 
% corresponding line to |get_rec_methods| function in |functions.cpp| and to |OpenCLRecMethods| 
% in |AF_opencl_functions.hpp|.
% 
% Next step is to modify |form_data_variables| function in |functions.cpp|. 
% For non-MAP/prior algorithms, add the algorithm after ACOSEM and initialize 
% it just like the previous ones (simply copy-paste and modify the |MethodList| 
% with your own prior name from previous step). For MAP/prior-based algorithms, 
% this step is not required.
% 
% If your prior or algorithm uses some algorithm/prior specific variables (constants, 
% weights, etc.), then you should load them preferably in |form_data_variables|. 
% It is recommended to save any necessary variables in the |options| struct in 
% MATLAB/Octave and then load these variables in |form_data_variables|. |w_vec| 
% struct can be used to store the variables.
% 
% If you are adding a subset using MAP/prior-based algorithm that uses priors 
% ONLY between iterations (i.e. the priors are NOT used during sub-iteration computations 
% as in e.g. BSREM), you need to add it to the list in |computeImplementation23.m| 
% (around line 135) and also add a new |push_back| step for |w_vec.mIt| in |form_data_variables| 
% with the cell index incremented (simply copy-paste the last one and increment 
% the second input of |mxGetCell|).
% 
% If the algorithm requires the full sensitivity image, add it to the list when 
% loading |w_vec.MBSREM_prepass| in |form_data_variables|. |w_vec.D| stores the 
% full sensitivity image, |pj3| is the same as |D|, but divided with the number 
% of subsets. |MRAMLA_prepass| should be used for all algorithms requiring either 
% (add them to the conditional(s)). You’ll also need to add it to the conditional 
% in |createKernels| and at the bottom in |createProgram| in |AF_opencl_functions.cpp|.
% 
% The following steps apply ONLY to algorithms using subsets or when adding 
% new priors:
% 
% First step is to modify |compute_OS_estimates_subiter.cpp| and add your own 
% algorithm and/or prior there. Non-MAP/prior-based algorithms should go after 
% ACOSEM. Priors and MAP/prior-based algorithms should go to the loop. The order 
% does not matter, however, with priors you should NOT use the custom prior style 
% (and it is recommended to place the prior before the custom prior). Note also 
% that you need to modify the bottom of |compute_OS_estimates_subiter.cpp| as 
% well when adding new priors.
% 
% Next step is required only if either of the two applies: - You are adding 
% a new prior and want it to work with BSREM and/or ROSEM-MAP - You are adding 
% a new MAP/prior-based algorithm that uses the prior information only after subiterations 
% are complete (e.g. as with BSREM)
% 
% Modify |compute_OS_estimates_iter.cpp| and add the prior to the list, just 
% like in |compute_OS_estimates_subiter.cpp|. For algorithms add the new one to 
% the list just like BSREM or ROSEM-MAP is. Remember to also modify the bottom 
% section if adding prior(s).
% 
% These steps apply ONLY to algorithms that DO NOT use subsets or when adding 
% new priors:
% 
% Modify |compute_ML_estimates.cpp| and add your own algorithm and/or prior 
% there. Non-MAP/prior-based algorithms should go after MLEM. Priors and MAP/prior-based 
% algorithms should go to the loop. The order does not matter, however, with priors 
% you should NOT use the custom prior style (and it is recommended to place the 
% prior before the custom prior). Be sure to uncomment the conditional if adding 
% MAP/prior-based algorithm. Note also that you need to modify the bottom of |compute_ML_estimates.cpp| 
% as well when adding new priors.
% 
% For custom-prior functionality, some further modifications may be necessary 
% such as loading of the full sensitivity image. Anything using |MethodList.CUSTOM| 
% points to the custom prior.
