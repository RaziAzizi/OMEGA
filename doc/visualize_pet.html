% This file contains some optional visualization options. You can plot a single 
% reconstruction. Iterations from a single reconstruction. A group of different 
% algorithms. The "true" image and a single reconstruction. The "true" image and 
% several different reconstruction algorithms. 3D volume of one reconstruction 
% by using the file exchange file <https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22940-vol3d-v2 
% vol3d v2>. You can also select the view to plot (transverse, frontal or sagittal). 
% Dynamic plotting is also supported.

% In case the selected algorithm does not exist in the cell matrix  (i.e. the 
% cell is empty), you will see a list of algorithms and their  numbers that the 
% cell matrix does contain.
