##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
%% Installation
% Toolbox installation
% Latest version of the toolbox can always be found from <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA 
% GitHub>. 
% 
% OMEGA can be obtained as a packaged toolbox from file exchange or as the collection 
% of the source code in GitHub. In the former case you only need to run the package 
% and the toolbox will be installed automatically and added to MATLAB path. OMEGA 
% can then be found from Add-ons REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH> Manage Add-Ons. The three dots on the right 
% allow you to open the toolbox folder in MATLAB, view documentation, uninstall 
% the package, etc.
% 
% If obtained as zip-file or through git (e.g. |git clone https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA|), 
% the toolbox folders need to be manually added to the MATLAB path. The toolbox 
% also needs to be manually uninstalled. Help documentation should be available 
% in MATLAB documentation as supplemental software.
% 
% Whether installed as a package or as a collection of individual files, the 
% |install_mex| function needs to be run first. This will automatically attempt 
% to build all required mex-files. Some of them might fail to build (e.g. ROOT 
% will always fail on Windows). You can view the build logs with |install_mex(1)|. 
% If OpenCL headers/ROOT/ArrayFire are in non-standard locations and not on path, 
% you can specify their paths with i|nstall_mex(0, OpenCL_include_path, OpenCL_lib_path, 
% AF_PATH, ROOT_PATH)|.  |OpenCL_include_path |should be the folder where |cl.h| 
% is located, |OpenCL_lib_path |the folder where |OpenCL.lib/libOpenCL.so| (Windows/Linux) 
% is located, |AF_PATH| the path to ArrayFire installation location and |ROOT_PATH| 
% to ROOT installation location.
% C++ compiler
% You're going to need C++ compiler in order to compile the MEX-files and use 
% this software. Visual Studio and GCC have been tested to work so I recommend 
% those depending on your platform. Specifically, Visual Studio  2015, 2017 and 
% 2019 have been tested to work on Windows 7/10 and as well as G++ 5.5, 6.4 and 
% 7.3 on Ubuntu 16.04/18.04. MinGW++ also works though the ArrayFire OpenCL reconstructions 
% (implementation 2) is not supported. Octave supports only MinGW++ and as such 
% implementation 2 on Windows is only supported if you manually compile ArrayFire 
% from source with MinGW. MinGW++ for MATLAB can be downloaded from <https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52848-matlab-support-for-mingw-w64-c-c-compiler 
% here>.
% 
% Visual studio can be downloaded <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ here>.
% OpenCL support
% In order to enable OpenCL support, you're going to need an OpenCL SDK and 
% (for implementation 2) ArrayFire (see below).
% 
% On Ubuntu Linux you can alternatively simply install the OpenCL headers (NOTE: 
% UNTESTED):
% 
% |sudo apt-get install opencl-headers|
% 
% and then the library:
% 
% |sudo apt-get install ocl-icd-libopencl1|
% 
% The SDK can be any (or all) of the following: CUDA Toolkit, Intel OpenCL SDK, 
% OCL-SDK or AMD APP SDK. On all cases, the OpenCL library and header files need 
% to be on your system's PATH. By default, the install_mex-file assumes that you 
% have installed CUDA toolkit (Linux and Windows), AMD APP SDK v3.0 (Linux and 
% Windows), OCL-SDK (Windows), AMD GPU Pro drivers (Linux) or Intel SDK (Linux 
% and Windows). If you get an  error message like "CL/cl.h: No such file or directory", 
% the headers  could not be found. You can also add these manually to |install_mex| 
% by adding |-I/path/to/CL| and |-L/path/to/OpenCLlib| before the .cpp file (simply 
% replace the CUDA paths with the correct ones). On Ubuntu you can use command 
% |find / -iname cl.h 2>/dev/null| to find the required cl.h file and |find / 
% -iname libOpenCL.so 2>/dev/null| to find the required library file. i|nstall_mex(0, 
% OpenCL_include_path, OpenCL_lib_path, AF_PATH, ROOT_PATH) |can be used to input 
% custom paths as well. See |install_mex.m| for further details. 
% 
% *All library paths needs to be on system path when running the mex-files or 
% otherwise the required libraries will not be found.*

% 
% <https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/OCL-SDK/releases https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/OCL-SDK/releases>
% 
% Once you have the header and library files, you need drivers/OpenCL runtimes 
% for your device(s). If you have GPUs/APUs then simply having  the vendor drivers 
% should be enough. For Intel CPUs without an integrated GPU you need CPU runtimes 
% (see the link below). 
% 
% For AMD CPUs it seems that the AMD drivers released around the summer 2018 
% and after no longer support CPUs so you need an older driver in order to get 
% CPU support or use an alternative runtime. One possibility is to use POCL <http://portablecl.org/ 
% http://portablecl.org/> and another is to try the Intel runtimes (link below).
% 
% Intel runtimes can be found here:
% 
% <https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-drivers https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-drivers>
% 
% % ArrayFire
% This software also uses ArrayFire library for the GPU/OpenCL implementation. 
% You can find AF binaries from here:
% 
% <https://arrayfire.com/download/ https://arrayfire.com/download/>
% 
% and the source code from here:
% 
% <https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire>
% 
% Installing/building ArrayFire to the default location (|C:\Program Files\ArrayFire| 
% on Windows, |/opt/arrayfire/| on Linux) should cause |install_mex| to automatically 
% locate everything. However, in both cases you need to add the library paths 
% to the system PATH. On Windows you will be prompted for this during the installation, 
% for Linux you need to add |/opt/arrayfire/lib| to the library path (e.g. |sudo 
% ldconfig /opt/arrayfire/lib/|).
% 
% If you are using MinGW on Windows, then the ArrayFre binaries above won't 
% work with it. In this case you need to manually build AF from the source with 
% MinGW.
