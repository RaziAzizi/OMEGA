%% Installation
% Toolbox installation
% For additional install help, see <installation_help.html installation help>.
% C++ compiler
% You're going to need a C++ compiler in order to compile the MEX-files and 
% properly use this software. Visual Studio and GCC have been tested to work and 
% are recommended depending on your platform. Specifically, Visual Studio  2015, 
% 2017 and 2019 have been tested to work on Windows 7/10 and as well as G++ 5.5, 
% 6.4, 7.3 and 9.3 on Ubuntu 16.04/18.04/20.04. MinGW++ also works though the

% 
% Visual studio can be downloaded <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ here>.
% Installing OMEGA
% Latest version of the toolbox can always be found from <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA 
% GitHub>. 
% 
% OMEGA can be obtained as a packaged toolbox from from the <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/releases 
% releases>-page on GitHub or as the collection of the source code in GitHub. 
% In the former case you only need to run the package and the toolbox will be 
% installed automatically and added to MATLAB path. OMEGA can then be found from 
% Add-ons REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH> Manage Add-Ons. The three dots on the right allow you to open the 
% toolbox folder in MATLAB, view documentation, uninstall the package, etc.
% 
% If obtained as zip-file or through git (e.g. |git clone https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA|), 
% the toolbox folders need to be manually added to the MATLAB path. The toolbox 
% also needs to be manually uninstalled. Help documentation should be available 
% in MATLAB documentation as supplemental software.
% 
% Whether installed as a package or as a collection of individual files, the 
% |install_mex| function needs to be run first. This will automatically attempt 
% to build all required mex-files. Some of them might fail to build (e.g. ROOT 
% will always fail on Windows). You can view the build logs with |install_mex(1)|. 
% If OpenCL headers/ROOT/ArrayFire are in non-standard locations and not on path, 
% you can specify their paths with i|nstall_mex(0, OpenCL_include_path, OpenCL_lib_path, 
% AF_PATH, ROOT_PATH)|.  |OpenCL_include_path |should be the folder where |cl.h| 
% is located, |OpenCL_lib_path |the folder where |OpenCL.lib/libOpenCL.so| (Windows/Linux) 
% is located, |AF_PATH| the path to ArrayFire installation location and |ROOT_PATH| 
% to ROOT installation location.
% OpenCL support
% In order to enable OpenCL support, you're going to need an OpenCL SDK and 
% (for implementation 2) ArrayFire (see below).
% 
% On Ubuntu Linux you can alternatively simply install the OpenCL headers (NOTE: 
% UNTESTED):
% 
% |sudo apt-get install opencl-headers|
% 
% and then the library:
% 
% |sudo apt-get install ocl-icd-libopencl1|
% 
% Alternative libraries in case the above one fails: |sudo apt-get install nvidia-opencl-dev 
% |or |sudo apt-get install intel-opencl-icd|
% 
% In case the above doesn't work or you use Windows then you need to  obtain 
% an OpenCL SDK. The SDK can be any (or all) of the following: CUDA Toolkit, Intel 
% OpenCL SDK, OCL-SDK, AMD APP SDK. On all cases, the  OpenCL library and header 
% files need to be on your system's PATH. By  default, the install_mex-file assumes 
% that you have installed CUDA  toolkit (Linux and Windows), AMD APP SDK v3.0 
% (Linux and Windows),  OCL-SDK (Windows), AMD GPU Pro drivers (Linux) or Intel 
% SDK (Linux and  Windows). If you get an error message like "CL/cl.h: No such 
% file or  directory", the headers could not be found. You can manually add custom 
% OpenCL paths with |install_mex(0, '/path/to/cl.h', '/path/to/libOpenCL.so')|. 
% On Ubuntu you can use command |find / -iname cl.h 2>/dev/null| to find the required 
% cl.h file and |find / -iname libOpenCL.so 2>/dev/null| to find the required 
% library file. See |install_mex.m| for further details.
% 
% *All library paths needs to be on system path when running the mex-files or 
% otherwise the required libraries will not be found.*

% 
% Once you have the header and library files, you need drivers/OpenCL runtimes 
% for your device(s). If you have GPUs/APUs then simply having  the vendor drivers 
% should be enough. For Intel CPUs without an integrated GPU you need CPU runtimes 
% (see the link below). 
% 
% For AMD CPUs it seems that the AMD drivers released around the summer 2018 
% and after no longer support CPUs so you need an older driver in order to get 
% CPU support or use an alternative runtime. One possibility is to use POCL <http://portablecl.org/ 
% http://portablecl.org/> and another is to try the Intel runtimes (link below).
% 
% Intel runtimes can be found here:
% 
% <https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-drivers https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-drivers>
% ArrayFire
% This software also uses ArrayFire library for the GPU/OpenCL implementation. 
% You can find AF binaries from here:
% 
% <https://arrayfire.com/download/ https://arrayfire.com/download/>
% 
% and the source code from here:
% 
% <https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire>
% 
% On Windows you should install <https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=48145 
% Visual Studio 2015 (x64) runtime libraries> first before installing ArrayFire.
% 
% Installing/building ArrayFire to the default location (|C:\Program Files\ArrayFire| 
% on Windows, |/opt/arrayfire/| on Linux/MacOS) should cause |install_mex| to 
% automatically locate everything. However, in both cases you need to  add the 
% library paths to the system PATH. On Windows you will be  prompted for this 
% during the installation, for Linux you need to add |/opt/arrayfire/lib| (bulding 
% from source) or |/opt/arrayfire/lib64| (installer) to the library path (e.g. 
% |sudo ldconfig /opt/arrayfire/lib64/|). Alternatively, on Linux, you can also 
% build/install it directly into the |/usr/local/| folder.
% 
% If you are using MinGW on Windows, then the ArrayFre binaries above won't 
% work with it. In this case you need to manually build AF from the source with 
% MinGW.
% CUDA
% Using CUDA code instead of OpenCL requires the CUDA toolkit. On both cases 
% the CUDA folder should be on the system path. |install_mex| always attempts 
% to build the CUDA code as well so no additional input  is required from the 
% user if all the header and library data is found.  By default |install_mex| 
% looks for CUDA in |/usr/local/cuda/| on Linux. On Windows, CUDA location is 
% determined from the environmental variables (PATH).
