OMEGA can automatically compute all the necessary parts for cylindrical PET scanner, but has not been designed for non-cylindrical systems. However, if you have a non-cylindrical scanner, you can try using it by inputting your own coordinates for the detectors. The detector coordinates are obtained from [`get_coordinates.m`](https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/source/get_coordinates.m) so modifying that function with your own detector coordinates might be enough to get it to work. However, this is untested and might not work.
