%% Toolbox overview
% The general structure of OMEGA can be divided into three different layers. 
% The top layer is the MATLAB/Octave user-interface that contains the scripts 
% and functions necessary to call the lower layers. The middle layer is the MATLAB 
% (C) MEX-interface that calls and computes the C++ code and then sends it back 
% to the top layer. The bottom layer, which is not always used, contains the OpenCL 
% kernels that compute the OpenCL code and then send the output data (reconstructed 
% images) to the middle layer. The bottom layer is only used if OpenCL code is 
% used. The middle layer can also be ignored, but this is not recommended and 
% not enabled by default as the pure MATLAB/Octave implementation is extremely 
% slow.
% 
% For the user, only the top layer is exposed. This is achieved in the form 
% of scripts that are referred to as _main-files_. These include |gate_main.m|, 
% |main_PET.m|, |Inveon_PET_main.m|, |Biograph_mCT_main.m|, |Biograph_Vision_main.m|, 
% |custom_prior_test_main.m|, and |forward_backward_projections_example.m|. It 
% is from these main-files that the actual functions are called. This is achieved 
% by storing all the user selected parameters to a MATLAB/Octave struct called 
% options, which is then input to the functions (e.g. when loading data or performing 
% image reconstruction). 
% 
% In the main-files most parameters are set either with numerical values (e.g. 
% |blocks_per_ring|, |span|, |tube_radius|) or as a true/false selection, where 
% true means that the feature is included and false that it is omitted (e.g. |randoms_correction|, 
% |scatter_smoothing|, |osem|). The main-files are divided into "sections" with 
% specific labels (MACHINE PROPERTIES, IMAGE PROPERTIES, SINOGRAM PROPERTIES, 
% etc.) that control different aspects. Many of these sections are completely 
% optional, e.g. CORRECTIONS section can be omitted if the user does not wish 
% to use any corrections. The only compulsory ones are MACHINE PROPERTIES and 
% either SINOGRAM or RAW DATA PROPERTIES. For reconstruction it is also advisable 
% to inspect the RECONSTRUCTION PROPERTIES section, but the default values should 
% always output a working OSEM estimate. By default all non-compulsory options 
% are set as false (with the exception of the Inveon main-file which has several 
% corrections enabled by default).
% 
% There are also several functions that work very independently without the 
% need for the main-files. These include file import and export functions, visualization 
% functions and many reconstruction algorithm functions. For help on many of these 
% functions, you should use |help function_name| or alternatively |doc function_name|. 
% E.g. |help saveImage|.
