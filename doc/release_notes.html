##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
%% Release notes
%% OMEGA v1.2.0
% New features
%% 
% * Added support for transmission tomography data
% * - Examples of computed tomography (CT) are included
% * - Supports same implementations and algorithms as PET data
% * - Implementation 1 always uses precomputation (this is done automatically)
% * - Precomputation is turned off in all other implementations
% * - Multi-ray Siddon and orthogonal distance-based ray tracer are not available
% * CUDA backend now supports list-mode reconstruction as well as the more efficient 
% median root prior
% * Added PKMA as a built-in algorithm for implementations 1, 2 and 4
% * Implemented a total overhaul of the built-in algorithms with implementations 
% 1, 2 and 4
% * - Adding new built-in algorithms or priors is much easier now
% * - This resulted in naming change for all non-MAP algorithms, regularization 
% parameters and some relaxation parameters
% * - Backwards compatibility is, however, maintained on all main-files except 
% (possibly) custom prior
% * - This has little to no effect on the normal user
% * Added relative difference prior for implementations 1, 2 and 4
% * - The current implementation can be memory intensive with large neighborhoods 
% or image sizes
% * Added support for 32-bit integer atomics (OpenCL only)
% * - Should give about 20-30% faster computations at the expense of accuracy
% * - Can cause integer overflow when the number of counts is high (in the range 
% of thousands per voxel)
% * - Numerical accuracy WILL be negatively affected
% * - Should be used only when speed is of utmost importance
% * GATE attenuation map from the MuMap actor can now be used as the attenuation 
% image
% * - Simply use the .mhd-file in |options.attenuation_datafile|
% * - The resolution should be the same as the output image
% * - Values are automatically scaled to 1/mm if they have some other units
% Bug fixes and enhancements
%% 
% * Fixed the use of corrections when using the forward/backward projection 
% class
% * Improved Siddon should be about 10-20% faster with Nvidia GPUs (affects 
% both OpenCL and CUDA)
% * Orthogonal and volume-based ray tracers should be a little faster
% * Fixed raw data sampling increase when using sampling larger than 2
% * Fixed custom normalization data load when the data was not in the current 
% working directory
% * |ImageMed| now accepts color limits (similar to imagesc)
% * Fixed MLEM with precomputed system matrix (implementation 1)
% * - PSF was not correctly applied before
% * - Not saving the intermediate iterations did not work before
% * Fixed possible warnings when using quadratic prior
% * Fixed a bug with quadratic prior when using implementations 1 or 4

% * Implementations 1 and 4 should now be faster
% * - This should be especially visible when using Octave
% * Fixed errors when using precomputed data with the MATLAB toolbox version
% * Compilation of ROOT support in Linux and MacOS environments can now specify 
% the ROOT installation directory
% * - Previously this was possible only on Windows despite the warning messages 
% suggesting the contrary
% * ROOT supports now scanners with more than 65535 crystals when using R2019a 
% or later (were previously supported only with R2018b and earlier)
% * R2019a and newer can now use the (unstable) ROOT data load
% * - When loading large ROOT files (about 2 GB), the data load might hang when 
% using R2019a and newer
% * - Using "legacy" ROOT data load (set with |options.legacyROOT = true|) fixes 
% this, but causes the same instability                         as with earlier 
% MATLAB versions
% * - Use the "legacy" ROOT data load with |-nojvm| MATLAB option to prevent 
% crashes
% * - Octave is unaffected
% * Octave fixes
% * - Fixed multi-ray Siddon
% * - Implementations 1 and 4 should be much faster now
% * - Forward/backward projection class was not always functioning before
% * Implementation 1 is faster when using R2021a or newer (not actually OMEGA 
% related)
% * Many MEX-files now use, when available, the new interleaved complex API
% * - Has no effect on the user
% * - Uses type-safe data access
% * Reduced the number of TOF integration points with trapezoidal rule from 
% 6 to 5
% * Fixed MetaImage load when the (raw) filename has uppercase letters
% * Fixed InterFile load when the (raw) file is in the working directory and

% (as long as the uncorrected sinogram already exists)
% * Added a global correction factor that can be used to correct all LORs with 
% the same correction factor (e.g. decay correction)

% in the crystal) can now be optionally saved with GATE data

% on the selected features
% * The user will be shown the selected data type (sinogram or raw),  selected 
% algorithm and prior, projector, corrections, device, etc.

% * This is the depth (mm) where the photon is assumed to have fully absorbed
% * Default value is 0, but can be set manually with |options.DOI|, e.g. |options.DOI

% 1
% * See |forward_backward_projections_example.m| for examples
% * Added support for different number of crystals in axial direction as well 
% as transaxial multiplier
% * Both values are optional
% * Number of crystals in axial direction is required only if number of  crystals 
% in axial direction is different from the number of crystals in  transaxial direction
% * Transaxial multiplier is required if blocks/modules/submodules are repeated 
% in transaxial direction
% * Added an example that demonstrates the use of both parameters
% * Added support for GATE submodules
% * The repeated component that includes the crystals can be either  RSector/Block, 
% Module or Submodule, i.e. both modules and submodules can be omitted
% * It is now possible to save only scattered coincidences that have  undergone 
% N scatter events in the same medium and with the same type  (e.g. Compton in 
% phantom)
% * For example, by setting |options.scatter_components = [2 0 0 0];|, only 
% scattered events that have undergone at least two Compton scatter  events in 
% the phantom will be stored in the scatter data
% * Compilation on MacOS should now work with both OpenMP (as long as it is

% the new |apply_accleration| variable
% * Gives about 30% faster speeds, but uses more device memory, especially on 
% GPUs
% * Added ability to specify the maximum ring difference with raw data
% * Sinogram creation can now load data created from different file type  than

% * Fixed a bug with check for LMF and ROOT input
% * Fixed a bug that caused sinogram formation to fail if you had not loaded 
% the data in the same session
% * Fixed a bug with sinogram segments that caused too low maximum ring difference 
% values to fail
% * Fixed a bug that caused sinogram z-coordinate creation to fail with certain 
% span and segment combinations
% * Also fixed some bugs in the z-coordinate creation
% * Fixed a bug involving pseudo detectors
% * The variable options.pseudot was also changed to NOT have the locations

% * Fixed a bug involving perpendicular detectors in improved Siddon (all versions)
% * Fixed some bugs in the matrix free OpenCL kernel

% * Corrupted ASCII files now work, skipping the corrupted line (with a warning 
% message)
% * ASCII data load is faster on MATLAB R2019a and up
% * ASCII data no longer needs the user to specify each column number, but rather 
% simply to copy-paste the coincidence mask.
% * ACOSEM didn't previously work if one of the other COSEMs weren't selected 
% as well
% * Wording of reconstruction methods changed to implementations
% * Attenuation correction wasn't working correctly when used with reconstruction 
% implementations 3 or 4 (currently implementations 4 and 2, respectively)
% * Adjusting the sinogram rotation previously had no effect, currently it instead 
% performs the rotation in the detector space allowing the user to rotate the 
% reconstructed image before it is actually reconstructed, though the precompute 
% phase needs to be performed first
% * 2D dimensions of the sinograms was flipped
% * Previously if no GATE output files were found, the data load would silently 
% fail
% * Related to the above change, the data load now also checks the current working 
% folder for GATE data if the folder specified in fpath-variable had no data (or 
% doesn't exist)
% * Switched the numbers of implementations 2 and 4, implementation 2 is now 
% the matrix free OpenCL implementation
% * Sequential reconstruction is now implementation 4
% * Implementation 1 and 4 now have parallel computation support
% * Implementation 1 uses C++11 threads, implementation 4 OpenMP
% * C++11 threads support also added to precomputation phase
% * Modified the included example to have shorter coincidence window, include 
% delayed coincidence events, scatter information and event IDs. Also changed 
% the simulation to backtoback type (faster simulation). Additional cylinder was 
% also added.
% * Added more comments, especially to the .cpp and .cl files
% * Default FMH weights now follow the same pattern as in the original article
% * Furthermore, the default weights were previously incorrectly calculated 
% if the neighborhood size (Ndx, Ndy or Ndz) was larger than 1
% * Default L-filter weights now resemble more closely Laplace distribution 
% as originally intended, however, only grid sizes 3 (Ndx = 1, Ndy = 0, Ndz = 
% 0), 9 (Ndx = 1, Ndy = 1, Ndz = 0) and 25 (Ndx = 2, Ndy = 2, Ndz = 0) use the 
% same values as in previous literature
% * L-filter also has an optional new weighting scheme where the weights are 
% (loosely) based on Laplace distribution, but mainly vary according to distance
% * Raw list-mode data and sinogram data now use the same reconstruction and 
% Siddon functions
% * Slight adjustments of default weights for weighted mean prior
% * MRAMLA (and MBSREM) follows the original article now
% * COSEM had an unnecessary multiplication with the scalar value present in 
% ACOSEM
% * ACOSEM had the first power factor in the wrong place (f*H)^(1/h) instead 
% of f^(1/h)*H
% * RAMLA, BSREM and regularized ROSEM MAP implementations now use the same 
% estimate for the first iteration
% * MRP works now even without image processing toolbox, though image processing 
% toolbox is still used if available
% * You can now choose to ignore the normalization step in MRP, L-filter, FMH, 
% AD and weighted mean
% * Matrix-free OpenCL implementation now pre-compiles the binary for the corresponding 
% device on the first run (implementation 2)
% * Separate binaries are created for each device used and for each projector
% * Optimizations to the OpenCL kernels
% * The number of precomputed MAT-files has been reduced and they are now stored 
% in mat-files-folder
% * Added separate precompute function for the OpenCL implementations (uses 
% single precision numbers instead of doubles)
% * The raw list-mode data file is now always saved initially. Sinograms can 
% be (if required) formed from this data
% * Install_mex now tries to build both the ROOT mex-files as well as the OpenCL/ArrayFire 
% mex-files. If the building process is not successful a warning is shown, but 
% the process is not halted. Install_mex(1) now shows the error logs if an error 
% is encountered and end the building process on error.
% * Previously known reconstruction method 5 has been deprecated; the codes 
% still exist (and the mex-files are built if OpenCL is found) and it can be used 
% by selecting implementation 5, but it has not been tested and will mostly likely 
% fail
% * 64-bit atomic operations can be used if the device used supports them (OpenCL 
% only)
% * Implementations 2, 3 and 4 are now faster on subsequent iterations due to 
% precomputation done on the first iteration. With OpenCL, this is only the case 
% if there is sufficient memory available on the device
% * Previously only MATLAB 2015a and up were supported, now older versions should 
% work as well
% * ROOT data import works without crashes on R2019a and up
