% AD and weighted mean
% * Matrix-free OpenCL implementation now pre-compiles the binary for the corresponding 
% device on the first run (implementation 2)
% * Separate binaries are created for each device used and for each projector
% * Optimizations to the OpenCL kernels
% * The number of precomputed MAT-files has been reduced and they are now stored 
% in mat-files-folder
% * Added separate precompute function for the OpenCL implementations (uses 
% single precision numbers instead of doubles)
% * The raw list-mode data file is now always saved initially. Sinograms can 
% be (if required) formed from this data
% * Install_mex now tries to build both the ROOT mex-files as well as the OpenCL/ArrayFire 
% mex-files. If the building process is not successful a warning is shown, but 
% the process is not halted. Install_mex(1) now shows the error logs if an error 
% is encountered and end the building process on error.
% * Previously known reconstruction method 5 has been deprecated; the codes 
% still exist (and the mex-files are built if OpenCL is found) and it can be used 
% by selecting implementation 5, but it has not been tested and will mostly likely 
% fail
% * 64-bit atomic operations can be used if the device used supports them (OpenCL 
% only)
% * Implementations 2, 3 and 4 are now faster on subsequent iterations due to 
% precomputation done on the first iteration. With OpenCL, this is only the case 
% if there is sufficient memory available on the device
% * Previously only MATLAB 2015a and up were supported, now older versions should 
% work as well
% * ROOT data import works without crashes on R2019a and up
