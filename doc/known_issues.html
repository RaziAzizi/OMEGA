##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
%% Known issues and limitations
% MATLAB & Octave
% Raw data with non-GATE data is still experimental (i.e. the data needs to 
% be formatted in the same way as done in OMEGA).
% 
% Multi-device/GPU reconstruction only supports OSEM and MLEM.
% 
% Implementation 4 (OpenMP CPU) supports only one prior/algorithm at a time.
% 
% LMF output currently has to contain the time stamp (cannot be removed in GATE) 
% and detector indices. The source location needs to be included if it was selected 
% in the main-file, same goes for the scatter data. If you have any other options 
% selected in the LMF output in GATE, then you will not get any sensible detector 
% data. Source locations and/or  scatter data can be deselected. LMF data, with 
% different format than in  GATE, are not supported.
% 
% LMF source information is a lot more unreliable than the ASCII or ROOT version.
% 
% Scanners with more detectors than 65536 will not work with the raw data format 
% of OMEGA.
% 
% Due to the same reason as above, maximum number of counts per sinogram pixel 
% is 65535 (applies only to GATE data).
% 
% Moving bed is not supported at the moment (needs to be step-and-shoot and 
% the different bed positions need to be handled as seprate cases).
% 
% Only cylindrical symmetric devices are supported inherently, for  other types 
% of machines the user has to input the detector coordinates.
% 
% Attenuation correction can be applied only with attenuation images (e.g. CT 
% images scaled to 511 keV).
% 
% ECAT geometry is supported only with ASCII data. ROOT data might also work 
% (untested).
% 
% If you are experiencing crashes when using implementation 2, it might be caused 
% by the graphics features of ArrayFire. In this case I  recommend renaming/removing 
% the libforge.so files from the ArrayFire  library folder (e.g. |/opt/arrayfire/lib64/|). 
% Alternatively you can install the no-gl AF:
% 
% <http://arrayfire.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html http://arrayfire.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html> 
% (3.6.2 is the latest). Finally, you can also simply build AF from  source, preferably 
% without building Forge. This seems to apply only to  Linux and affects both 
% MATLAB and Octave.
% MATLAB
% If you get GLIBCXX_3.4.XX/CXXABI_1.3.XX not found error or an error  about 
% "undefined reference to dlopen/dlclose/dlsomethingelse" when  building or running 
% files, this should be fixed with one of the methods  presented here:
% 
% <https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/329796-issue-with-libstdc-so-6 
% https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/329796-issue-with-libstdc-so-6>
% 
% If you are using ROOT data with ROOT 6.18.00 or newer you might  receive the 
% following error message: "undefined symbol:  _ZN3tbb10interface78internal20isolate_within_arenaERNS1_13delegate_baseEl". 
% This is caused by the |libtbb.so.2| used by MATLAB (located in |/matlabroot/bin/glnxa64|). 
% Same solutions apply as with the above case (e.g. renaming the file).
% 
% ROOT data import is unstable in MATLAB R2018b and earlier versions  due to 
% a library incompatibility between the Java virtual machine in  MATLAB and ROOT. 
% On Linux you will experience MATLAB crashes when  importing ROOT data. There 
% is a workaround for this by using MATLAB in  the no Java mode (e.g |matlab -nojvm|), 
% though you won't have any GUI or graphic features. MATLAB R2019a and up are 
% unaffected.
% 
% ROOT is not supported on Windows, though it should, theoretically,  work if 
% you use ROOT with 32-bit MATLAB, but this is untested.
% Octave
% Implementation 2 (ArrayFire matrix free OpenCL) is not supported on   Windows 
% due to a compiler incompatability between MinGW and ArrayFire.  As mentioned 
% elsewhere, this can be fixed by building ArrayFire from  source with MinGW.
% 
% Almost all MATLAB-based code runs significantly slower compared to MATLAB 
% (this is due to the slowness of loops in Octave). Reconstructions are unaffected.
% 
% MAT-files that are over 2 GB are not supported by Octave and such large data 
% sets cannot be saved in Octave at the moment.
