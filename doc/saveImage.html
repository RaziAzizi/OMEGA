%% saveImage
% This function allows you to save the reconstructed images created by  OMEGA 
% to a specified medical imaging format. Currently supported are  NIfTI, Analyze 
% 7.5, DICOM, Interfile, MetaImage and raw binary data  without header.
% 
% DICOM support requires image processing toolbox on MATLAB and dicom  package 
% on Octave (untested on Octave). NIfTI requires either image  processing toolbox 
% OR <https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image 
% Tools for NIfTI and ANALYZE image> from MathWorks file exchange. Analyze requires 
% Tools for NIfTI and ANALYZE image.
% 
% DICOM conversion currently does not support time-series data and also produces 
% one image for each slice.
% 
% The OMEGA created |pz| cell matrices can be used as input. All non-empty cells 
% are saved in a separate file. Saving a NIfTI format image would in this case 
% work with |saveImage(pz,'nifti')|. Analyze support is enabled with |analyze|, 
% DICOM support with |dicom|, Interfile with |interfile| and raw with |raw|. Only 
% one data type can be saved at a time.
% 
% Single 3D, 4D or 5D image can be used as input as well. 4D images are expected 
% to be the same is in OMEGA, where the 4th dimension is the  number of iterations 
% (last iteration is always used). 5th dimension is  considered as time in the 
% non-cell case. The images need to be in the  XxYxZ(xNiterxT) format. When using 
% a single image, either the output filename or |options| struct has to be input. 
% Saving voxel size in the output images requires |options| to be input in the 
% non-cell case.
% 
% All file types use the same variable type as the input data (i.e.  single 
% (f32) precision when using the cell-matrix created by OpenCL  methods) except 
% DICOM which always uses double.
