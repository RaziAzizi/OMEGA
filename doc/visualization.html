##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
%% Visualization in OMEGA
% OMEGA includes several ready-made visualization codes in <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/visualize_pet.m 
% |visualize_pet.m|>. These are divided into sections separated by the double 
% percentage sign (%%). All visualization is performed in loops, where all the 
% slices  from the selected view (transverse, sagittal or coronal) are looped  
% through starting from the first slice.
% 
% The first section simply loads the struct variable that contains  various 
% information about the reconstruction that was saved. These  include e.g. number 
% of iterations, number of time steps, data type  (sinogram or raw), projector 
% used, implementation used, FOV size, etc.  You can modify <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/source/save_image_properties.m 
% |save_image_properties.m|> to add your own information.
% 
% The second section visualizes the selected algorithms for all slices  at the 
% last iteration. Any number of algorithms can be selected, though  using more 
% than 8 will most likely cause the image to be too small.  Color scale (|color_scale| 
% variable) can be adjusted as well as the algorithm from where the color scale 
% is taken (|color_from_algo|). Using |color_from_algo = 0| causes the color scale 
% to be individual to each algorithm, i.e. there is no unified color scale.
% 
% Running any of the sections with algorithms selected that are not included 
% in the input |pz| variable will show a message indicating what algorithms, and 
% their cell numbers, are included.
% 
% Third section visualizes N last iterations of one algorithm.
% 
% Fourth section is similar to second, except now the original source  image 
% can be included to the visualization as well. The original source  image always 
% uses its own color scale.
% 
% Fifth section includes a 3D volumetric visualization with the help of <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22940-vol3d-v2 
% |vol3d v2|>. You need to download the function from file exchange and put it 
% in the  MATLAB/Octave path in order for it to work. Alpha scale can be adjusted  
% in order to make areas with less counts more transparent.
% 
% Sixth section allows you to visualize all three different views  (transverse, 
% coronal, sagittal) at the same time for the selected  algorithms.
% 
% Last section is dedicated to dynamic visualization and allows the  selected 
% slice to be viewed as a function of time. Original source image and different 
% views are supported as well.
%% Other visualization possibilities
% It is also possible to visualize the data with tools that are not  included 
% in OMEGA. Here are some tips that might be useful, but as the  images are simple 
% matrices you can use anything that can visualize  matrices.
% 
% The reconstructed images are structured as follows: the |pz|-cell array contains 
% all the algorithms that were reconstructed. Each cell element is of size Nx 
% x Ny x Nz x Niter x Nt, where Nx/y/z is the image size in x/y/z-direction, Niter 
% is the number of iterations (including initial value) and Nt is the number of 
% time steps/slices (omitted if static reconstruction). Last iteration can be 
% obtained with |end|, e.g. |A = pz{2}(:,:,:,end)| will extract the 3D OSEM image 
% at the last iteration.
% 
% In case you wish to visualize the 3D images as slices with mouse  control 
% for the slice numbers, there are several different functions  available. From 
% MATLAB R2019b and up you can use <https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/sliceviewer.html 
% |sliceViewer|> if you have the image processing toolbox. Alternatively you can 
% try <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47463-imshow3dfull 
% |imshow3dfull|>, <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/21993-viewer3d 
% |viewer3d|> and <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/72978-volview 
% |volview|>. For 3D volumetric viewing, you can also use the <https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/volumeviewer-app.html 
% |volumeViewer|> app in MATLAB if you have image processing toolbox and at least 
% MATLAB R2017a.
