%% Biograph data
% Main-files for the Biograph machines mCT and Vision are available. All the 
% detector parameters as well as sinogram settings are set correctly for the machines.
% 
% For mCT supported are 64-bit list-mode data, 32-bit list-mode data, UNCOMPRESSED 
% sinograms and GATE data. For Vision 64-bit list-mode data, UNCOMPRESSED sinograms 
% and GATE data. 
% 
% The mex-files used to load the list-mode data are provided as a closed-source 
% release ONLY, i.e. the source code for these files is not available. These mex-files 
% are stored in the biograph-folder where you can find mex-files for Windows and 
% Linux (no Mac support). Included are files for MATLAB only, Octave files are 
% available only on request. For MATLAB, version 2015a or newer should work. It 
% is recommended to delete the version that you do not need. For MATLAB the files 
% have an ending mexw64 (Windows) and mexa64 (Linux). list2sinogram corresponds 
% to mCT while visionToSinogram to Vision.
% 
% When using list-mode or sinogram data, you will be prompted for the location 
% of the files. For list-mode data, the data can be either .ptd or .l files. For 
% sinograms, either .ptd or .s. Furthermore, the location of the mex-file needs 
% to be on MATLAB path in order to use list-mode data. Sinogram data is not affected.
%% Sinogram gap filling
% mCT and Vision both include pseudo detectors by default and mCT also  pseudo 
% rings. While these are not compulsory in OMEGA (you can  reconstruct the data 
% successfully even without pseudo detectors and/or  rings) you can still use 
% them as they are used by the machine itself  (mCT uses both, Vision only detectors). 
% Since these detectors do not  actually collect any counts they will cause gaps 
% in the sinogram. How  these gaps are filled depends on your mashing factor and 
% whether  normalization is applied.
% 
% In mCT, the mashing factor of 2 is applied which is also default in  OMEGA. 
% This causes many of the pseudo detectors to lose their "zero"  counts. Furthermore, 
% in clinical setting, this mashed sinogram is  multiplied with the normalization 
% matrix (e.g. precorrection of the  data) to obtain the corrected sinogram. In 
% this case, there are only a  few gaps compared to case without mashing. Pseudo 
% rings are assumed to  be fixed by the normalization which takes into account 
% the pseudo  detectors and/or rings.
% 
% While the above method is the one used by the machine itself, it is  not the 
% only way to do gap filling in OMEGA. OMEGA supports gap filling  also without 
% normalization data and without any mashing. In this case,  however, the results 
% are mostly likely not the same as obtained with the method used by the machine 
% itself.
% 
% The gap filling can be performed by two different methods, MATLAB's built-in 
% function |fillmissing| or by using a function from the Mathworks file exchange 
% <https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4551-inpaint_nans |inpaint_nans|>. 
% |fillmissing| is currently unavailable in Octave. If you are using the method 
% used by the machine itself, the method used should not make a difference. If  
% you are using unmashed data without normalization, |inpaint_nans| might provide 
% slightly better results.
% 
% Currently, the normalization data output by the scanner is not  supported. 
% In order to apply normalization correction, you need to  simulate one in GATE. 
% For request I can also send a download link to mCT normalization file obtained 
% from simulations and constructed with  OMEGA, that removes almost all artifacts.
% 
% Vision handles things differently, for example by having significant  mashing, 
% which is not applied in OMEGA. In OMEGA, Vision data should be, for the moment, 
% reconstructed with the default values input into the  main-file.
% 
% Raw data does not support pseudo detectors or rings and as such will never 
% use them even if they are selected.
