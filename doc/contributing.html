%% Contributing code to OMEGA
% Contributions of external code to OMEGA are both desired and encouraged. Any 
% and all functions/code enhancements are welcomed, whether they are e.g. new 
% reconstruction algorithms, image analysis tools or new supported machines (even 
% simply main files).
% 
% If you wish to add your own code to OMEGA, you should either open an <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/issues 
% issue>, submit a <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/pulls pull request> or simply 
% send an <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki#contact e-mail> to me. The function 
% can be either m-file, C++-file or OpenCL (cl) function.
% 
% If the function is a new reconstruction algorithm written in m-file, it can 
% be ported by the OMEGA developer(s) to OpenCL, depending on the complexity of 
% the algorithm. Functions utilizing e.g. the forward and backward projections 
% of OMEGA can be included as well.
% 
% New algorithms will be added to the list of supported algorithms along with 
% the provided citation(s). Other features will be added to the feature list along 
% with the provided citation(s). The function itself should include mention of 
% the authors of the file and the license.
% 
% Functions do not need to include documentation or examples, however, depending 
% on the complexity of the code, this might delay the publication and inclusion 
% of the code.
