%% Using Inveon PET data
% This page describes the contents of the open Siemens Inveon PET data. The 
% data can be obtained from: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3528056 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3528056>
%% Files included
% |FDG_Naive_R01_PET_Em_F18_60min_v1.lst| is the raw list-mode data. Each event 
% is stored in binary format with the tag related information. For decrypting 
% the list-mode data itself, you should contact Siemens. A header file is also 
% included that has some general information on the measurement and the device.
% 
% |FDG_Naive_R01_PET_Em_F18_60min_v1.scn| contains the sinogram created by the 
% PET machine/acquisition computer itself. Randoms correction has already been 
% included in the form of subtraction. This sinogram is dynamic and contains 28 
% frames. A header file is included that contains more detailed information on 
% the file.
% 
% |FDG_Naive_R01_PET_Em_F18_60min_v1_sct.scn| this is the machine created dynamic 
% SCATTER sinogram. Format is exactly the same as the regular sinogram. This should 
% be used for potential scatter correction.
% 
% |FDG_Naive_R01_PTX_At_10min_v1.atn| this contains the attenuation data. This 
% cannot be used as-is. In OMEGA this measurement data is reconstructed and then 
% used in the attenuation correction, by using the reconstructed images as the 
% attenuation images.
% 
% |Norm_PNM_Normalization_with_Cylinder_v1.nrm| is the normalization data. The 
% inverse of this should be multiplied with the sinogram for normalization correction 
% (when normalization is not included in the reconstruction). In OMEGA, this can 
% be used as the user normalization.
%% Inveon data in OMEGA
% When using the Inveon data in OMEGA, one should use |Inveon_PET_main.m| file. 
% All the geometry and sinogram values have been adjusted just as the defaults 
% are. This file includes support for GATE data, so when using the list-mode or 
% sinogram data all the GATE specific sections can be ignored.
% 
% Inveon data format is chosen in the second block/section below MACHINE PROPERTIES 
% (INVEON DATA). Here you can specify whether to use GATE data (|options.use_machine 
% = 0|), the list-mode (.lst) data (|options.use_machine = 1|, default) or sinogram 
% data (|options.use_machine = 2|). For the list-mode case, the user will be prompted 
% for the location of the list-mode data file when |load_data| is run. For the 
% sinogram case, the prompt will be during sinogram formation (|form_sinograms|). 
% Using GATE data works just as with any other GATE data.
% 
% When using any corrections, same rules and features apply as with any data.
% 
% If |options.randoms_correction| is set to true, then the delayed coincidences 
% will be automatically loaded when the prompts are loaded as well.
% 
% When using scatter correction, you can use the provided scn-files when prompted 
% for the scatter data. Scatter data will be prompted FIRST, if you have it enabled.
% 
% In static cases, the dynamic sinograms are summed together. However, if dynamic 
% reconstruction are performed, then the number of time steps need to be same 
% as in the sinograms (28) or less. Raw list-mode data is NOT affected by this; 
% it can have any number of time steps.
% 
% Normalization is included if |options.normalization_correction = true| and 
% |options.use_user_normalization = true|. The user will then be prompted for 
% the normalization file (.nrm) either during sinogram creation (if |options.corrections_during_reconstruction 
% = false|) or after image reconstruction is initiated.
% 
% For attenuation correction, first |options.attenuation_correction| must be 
% set to |true| and secondly the section containing the function (or the function 
% itself) |attenuation_correction_factors| needs to be run. The user will then 
% be prompted to select the provided .atn-file. The function will then save a 
% mat-file containing the attenuation images reconstructed from the attenuation 
% sinogram. The output is the path to this mat-file which is needed during the 
% image reconstruction phase. By default, no additional actions are needed from 
% the user. For future use, it is recommended to modify |options.attenuation_datafile| 
% path after |options.attenuation_correction| to the path of the saved attenuation 
% datafile. Filename itself is enough if the file is in MATLAB search path.
%% Remarks on reconstruction
% The recommended (and default) resolution for the final image is 128x128x159. 
% Arc correction is recommended as it decreases aliasing artifacts. Arc correction 
% uses parallel computing toolbox (|parfor|) if it is available.
% 
% Using higher resolution (256x256x159) causes aliasing artifacts with all projectors 
% though orthogonal distance-based ray tracer in _3D_ mode only has some artifacts 
% on higher iterations. Using other projectors is possible if the sampling rate 
% (`options.sampling`) is increased. Using a sampling rate of 4x should remove 
% aliasing artifacts even with 1 ray Siddon. Arc correction may not be required 
% when using increased sampling rate.
% 
% Another solution to prevent aliasing artifacts should be the use of regularization, 
% but this is untested.
% 
% It is not recommended to use 3D orthogonal projector on CPU with 256x256x159 
% resolution.
