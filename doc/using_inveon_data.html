%% Using Inveon PET data
% This page describes the contents of the open Siemens Inveon PET data. The 
% data can be obtained from: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3528056 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3528056>
%% Files included
% |FDG_Naive_R01_PET_Em_F18_60min_v1.lst| is the list-mode data. Each event 
% is stored in binary format with the tag related information. For decrypting 
% the list-mode data itself, you should contact Siemens. A header file is also 
% included that has some general information on the measurement and the device.
% 
% |FDG_Naive_R01_PET_Em_F18_60min_v1.scn| contains the sinogram created by the 
% PET machine/acquisition computer itself. Randoms correction has already been 
% included in the form of subtraction. This sinogram is dynamic and contains 28 
% frames. A header file is included that contains more detailed information on 
% the file.
% 
% |FDG_Naive_R01_PET_Em_F18_60min_v1_sct.scn| this is the machine created dynamic 
% SCATTER sinogram. Format is exactly the same as the regular sinogram. This should 
% be used for potential scatter correction.
% 
% |FDG_Naive_R01_PTX_At_10min_v1.atn| this contains the attenuation data. This 
% cannot be used as-is. In OMEGA this measurement data is reconstructed and then 
% used in the attenuation correction, by using the reconstructed images as the 
% attenuation images.
% 
% |Norm_PNM_Normalization_with_Cylinder_v1.nrm| is the normalization data. The 
% inverse of this should be multiplied with the sinogram for normalization correction 
% (when normalization is not included in the reconstruction). In OMEGA, this can 
% be used as the user normalization.
%% Inveon data in OMEGA
% When using the Inveon data in OMEGA, one should use |Inveon_PET_main.m| file. 
% All the geometry and sinogram values have been adjusted just as the defaults 
% are. This file includes support for GATE data, so when using the list-mode or 
% sinogram data all the GATE specific sections can be ignored. By default the 
% main file has enabled list-mode data, randoms correction, attenuation correction, 
% normalization correction using the provided normalization (.nrm) file and uses 
% sinogram data for reconstruction with `128x128x159` resolution. Scatter correction 
% is NOT enabled by default.
% 
% Inveon data format is chosen in the second block/section below MACHINE PROPERTIES 
% (INVEON DATA). Here you can specify whether to use GATE data (|options.use_machine 
% = 0|), the list-mode (.lst) data (|options.use_machine = 1|, default) or sinogram 
% data (|options.use_machine = 2|). For the list-mode case, the user will be prompted 
% for the location of the list-mode data file when |load_data| is run. For the 
% sinogram case, the prompt will be during sinogram formation (|form_sinograms|). 
% Using GATE data works just as with any other GATE data.
% 
% When using any corrections, same rules and features apply as with any data.
% 
% If |options.randoms_correction| is set to true, then the delayed coincidences 
% will be automatically loaded when the prompts are loaded as well.
% 
% When using scatter correction, you can use the provided scn-files when prompted 
% for the scatter data. Scatter data will be prompted FIRST, if you have it enabled.
% 
% If you are using the provided SINOGRAM (.scn) file instead of the list-mode 
% file, in static cases the dynamic sinograms are summed together. However, if 
% dynamic reconstruction is performed, then the number of time steps needs to 
% be same as in the sinogram (28) or less. If you create your own sinogram or 
% raw data from the list-mode file, you can specify any number of time steps.
% 
% Normalization is included if |options.normalization_correction = true|. In 
% order to use the provided .nrm-file then you should set |options.use_user_normalization 
% = true|. The user will then be prompted for the normalization file (.nrm) either 
% during sinogram creation (if |options.corrections_during_reconstruction = false|) 
% or right before image reconstruction is initiated. If |options.use_user_normalization 
% = false|, then OMEGA will attempt to find user-created normalization (.mat) 
% file, i.e. normalization file created by OMEGA.
% 
% For attenuation correction, first |options.attenuation_correction| must be 
% set to |true| and secondly the section containing the function (or the function 
% itself) |attenuation_correction_factors| needs to be run. The user will then 
% be prompted to select the provided .atn-file. The function will then save a 
% mat-file containing the attenuation images reconstructed from the attenuation 
% sinogram. The output is the path to this mat-file which is needed during the 
% image reconstruction phase. By default, no additional actions are needed from 
% the user. For future use, it is recommended to modify |options.attenuation_datafile| 
% path after |options.attenuation_correction| to the path of the saved attenuation 
% datafile. Filename itself is enough if the file is in MATLAB search path, i.e. 
% current directory which is the default.
% 
% If you are using your own Inveon data and have access to Inveon CT, you can 
% also use the created UMAP-images as the attenuation correction. This can be 
% enabled by setting |options.use_CT = true| and running the aforementioned |attenuation_correction_factors|.
%% Remarks on reconstruction
% The recommended (and default) resolution for the final image is 128x128x159. 
% Arc correction is recommended (but not enabled as default) as it decreases aliasing 
% artifacts. Arc correction uses parallel computing toolbox (|parfor|) if it is 
% available.
% 
% Using higher resolution (256x256x159) causes aliasing artifacts with improved 
% Siddon ray tracer, but works fine with orthogonal and volume-based ray tracers. 
% Alternatively, improved Siddon with PSF also removes the aliasing artifacts 
% (when FWHM is sufficiently large). Using improved Siddon without PSF is possible 
% if the sampling rate (|options.sampling|) is increased. Using a sampling rate 
% of 4x should remove aliasing artifacts even with 1 ray Siddon. Arc correction 
% may not be required when using increased sampling rate or when using PSF or 
% any of the other projectors.
% 
% Another solution to prevent aliasing artifacts should be the use of regularization, 
% but this is untested.
% 
% It is not recommended to use implementation 1 when using 256x256x159 resolution 
% or if using any other projector except improved Siddon.
% 
% In all cases, the volume based ray tracer should produce best results, but 
% is also very slow. Improved Siddon with PSF is the most cost-effective method.
