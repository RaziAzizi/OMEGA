%% Custom detector coordinates and/or list mode reconstruction
% This page details on how to separately compute the forward and/or backward 
% projections when using OMEGA.
%% Computing the forward and/or backward projections
% When you are manually computing the forward and/or backward projections, it 
% is recommended to use the <forward_backward_projections_example.m forward_backward_projections_example.m> 
% and modify it according to your specifications.
% 
% The initial part works very much like <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/main_PET.m 
% main_PET.m>, however, there are no adjustments for the reconstruction algorithms. 
% You still need to input the necessary information (scanner properties, sinogram/raw 
% data properties, corrections, etc.) before proceeding. For |options.precompute_lor 
% = true| you also need to perform the precomputation phase if it hasn't been 
% performed before. Note that if you want the measurement data to be precorrected, 
% you need to do that manually. Corrections during reconstruction are applied 
% automatically, though in some cases (such as randoms correction) you need to 
% select the correction data when it is prompted.
% 
% For the reconstruction, implementations 1, 3 and 4 are supported with 3 recommended.
% 
% After the initial setup phase, there are two different ways to actually compute 
% _Ax_ and _A^Ty_. The first, recommended, method is by using a MATLAB/Octave 
% class that is demonstrated in the initial examples in <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/forward_backward_projections_example.m#L821 
% forward_backward_projections_example.m>, the second method is the old one using 
% functions.
% Class based examples
% First is a class-based exampled computing OSEM/MLEM estimates (line 821) with 
% the use of the special forward and backward projection operators. The major 
% steps needed for class based use is the creation of the class object with |forwardBackwardProject(options)| 
% and the load of the measurement data. Sensitivity image can be obtained from 
% the backprojection. PSF is applied automatically if selected.
% 
% You can also create the same class object as above without the need for any 
% of the main-files, however, several features are then unavailable (such as corrections). 
% This is achieved by inputting the required variables manually: |A = forwardBackwardProject(Nx, 
% Ny, Nz, FOVa_x, axial_fov, diameter, rings, cr_p, cr_pz, cryst_per_block, blocks_per_ring, 
% det_per_ring, Ndist, Nang,NSinos, span, ring_difference, subsets, implementation, 
% use_device, projector_type, tube_width_z, tube_radius, voxel_radius, use_psf, 
% FWHM);|
% 
% To use your own measurement data, replace |load('Cylindrical_PET_example_cylpet_example_sinograms_combined_static_200x168x703_span3.mat','raw_SinM')| 
% with your own custom load or simply run the code up to that and manually load 
% your data (you can use |loadMeasurementData| to load custom data, such as interfiles). 
% You should either name your measurement data as |raw_SinM| or rename all instances 
% of |raw_SinM| to the same name as your input measurement data (|options.SinM| 
% if you use |loadMeasurementData|). Your input data needs to be oriented the 
% same way as the measurement data used in OMEGA. For sinograms that is thus |options.Ndist| 
% x |options.Nang| x |options.NSinos|. Dynamic data needs to be manually correctly 
% formatted.
% 
% The second class-based example computing Conjugate-gradient Least-squares 
% (CGLS) utilizes the operator overloading. This means that after you have created 
% the class (e.g. with |A = forwardBackwardProject(options);|) you can then simply 
% multiply this with the desired vector (e.g. |A * x| or |A * y|). Whether forward 
% or backward projection is computed, is determined automatically from the dimensions 
% of the input vector. Alternative, backprojection can be forced with |A' * y|.
% 
% Other examples include LSQR, SA-WLS (includes TOF example), ATP-WLS, EM-PKMA 
% with TV regularization and ADMM with TV. Of these, EM-PKMA and ADMM provide 
% examples on how to use the built-in priors. Prepass functions must be run for 
% the following priors: 
% 
% MRP (|options = computeOffsets(options);|)
% 
% Quadratic prior (|options = computeWeights(options);| and |options = quadWeights(options, 
% options.empty_weight);|)
% 
% Huber prior (|options = computeWeights(options);| and |options = huberWeights(options);|)
% 
% L-filter (|options = computeWeights(options);|, |options = computeOffsets(options);| 
% and |options.a_L = lfilter_weights(options.Ndx, options.Ndy, options.Ndz, options.FOVa_x/options.Nx, 
% options.FOVa_y/options.Ny, options.axial_fov/options.Nz, options.oneD_weights);|)
% 
% FMH (|options = computeWeights(options);|, |options = computeOffsets(options);| 
% and |options = fmhWeights(options);|)
% 
% Weighted mean (|options = computeWeights(options);| and |options = weightedWeights(options);|)
% 
% TV (|options = TVPrepass(options);|, the following ONLY when |options.TVtype 
% = 3|: |options = computeWeights(options);|, |options = computeOffsets(options);| 
% and |options = quadWeights(options, options.empty_weight);|)
% 
% APLS (|options = APLSPrepass(options);|)
% 
% NLM (|options = NLMPrepass(options);|).
% 
% Furthermore, you can also obtain the (subset of the) system matrix from the 
% same class object. This is demonstrated in the System matrix (OSEM) example 
% between SA-WLS and ATP-WLS.
% Function based examples

% forward_backward_projections_example.m>. It is no longer recommended to compute 
% the forward and/or backward projections this way.
% 
% You'll need to run the <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/source/index_maker.m 
% index_maker.m> as specified to get the necessary subset indices. The line |[gaussK, 
% options] = PSFKernel(options);| is only applicable if PSF reconstruction is 
% used as it creates the PSF kernel gaussK.
% 
% To use your own measurement data, replace |load('Cylindrical_PET_example_cylpet_example_sinograms_combined_static_200x168x703_span3.mat','raw_SinM'|) 
% with your own custom load or simply run the code up to that and manually load 
% your data. You should either name your measurement data as |raw_SinM| or rename 
% all instances of |raw_SinM| to the same name as your input measurement data. 
% Your input data needs to be oriented the same way as the measurement data used 
% in OMEGA. For sinograms that is thus |options.Ndist| x |options.Nang| x |options.NSinos|. 
% Dynamic data needs to be manually correctly formatted.
% 
% After the above steps, simply use the functions [forward_project](https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/source/forward_project.m) 
% and [backproject](https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/source/backproject.m) 
% as you like. The example provided uses them the same way as in OSEM, but as 
% they simply implement the operations _y = Ax_ and _x = A^Tb_, respectively, 
% you can implement any algorithm that uses these matrix-vector operations. An 
% example of PSF reconstruction is included as well. Sensitivity image is obtained 
% with backprojection, but can also be omitted by simply having only one output 
% parameter.
% 
% All selected corrections are applied to the forward and/or backward projections. 
% If you wish to use different projectors for the forward or backward projections, 
% you need to manually set options.projector_type between them. E.g. compute forward 
% projection when |options.projector_type = 2| and then set |options.projector_type 
% = 1| and compute backprojection. This, however, is untested and may especially 
% not work when using implementation 1. If you wish to use different projectors, 
% it is recommended to use implementation 3 and set |options.precompute_lor = 
% false|.
% 
% The optional PSF deblurring phase can also be performed and an example of 
% that is also included.
%% List-mode reconstruction/custom detectors
% There is also a "simplified" version of the forward/backward  projection class. 
% This simplified version accepts the detector  coordinates for each coincidence 
% as well as the FOV size and image size. The input structure is thus:
% 
% |A = forwardBackwardProject(x, y, z, Nx, Ny, Nz, FOVtr, axial_fov, subsets, 
% implementation, platform)|
% 
% where |x|, |y| and |z| are the detector coordinates corresponding to every 
% element of the input measurement data (vector or matrix), |Nx/y/z| are the image 
% size in x/y/z-directions, |FOVtr| the FOV size in transaxial direction (length 
% of one side of the square), |axial_fov| the size of the FOV in axial direction, 
% |subsets| is an optional number of subsets (can be omitted), |implementation| 
% the optional implementation that should be used (4 is default, can be omitted) 
% and |platform| the device platform for implementation 3 (default is 0, can be 
% omitted, ignored when implementation 4 is used). Implementations 3 and 4 are  
% currently supported.
% 
% When used like this, however, no corrections or PSF are supported.  All these 
% operations need to be done manually by the user. An example of this type of 
% reconstruction is presented in <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/Inveon_PET_main_listmode_example.m 
% |Inveon_PET_main_listmode_example.m|>.
%% CT data
% For CT data, only the class based functionality is supported. Examples are 
% available in |walnut2D_CT_main.m|, |walnut_CT_main.m| and |Inveon_CT_main.m|, 
% where the first one is a pure 2D (fan-beam) example while the latter  two are 
% 3D (cone-beam) examples (it is possible to convert the latter  two to 2D as 
% well). In all cases, it is assumed that the source is  initially at the bottom 
% of the image and rotates counter-clockwise.
% 
% There are three different ways to construct the class object. The recommended 
% method is to use one of the example main-files as a basis and construct the 
% class object by using the |options| struct: |A = forwardBackwardProjectCT(options)|. 
% Both the improved Siddon and volume-based ray tracers are available  with this 
% method as well as automatic PSF if selected. With this method, it is also possible 
% to easily affect the initial position of the source by using the |options.offangle| 
% value.
% 
% Alternatively, it is possible to construct the class object without the |options| 
% struct, either by using the projection angles or by inputting the  detector 
% coordinates for every measurement point. In the first case  (angles), the constructor 
% is |A = forwardBackwardProjectCT(angles, ySize, xSize, Nx, Ny, Nz, FOVa_x, axial_fov, 
% dPitch, sourceToDetector, sourceToCRot, horizontalOffset, bedOffset, subsets, 
% implementation, deviceN)|. |angles| are the angles corresponding to each projection, 
% |ySize| is the number of rows in a single projection image, |xSize| the number 
% of columns, |Nx|, |Ny|, |Nz| are dimensions of the estimated image, |FOVa_x| 
% is the size of the transaxial FOV, |axial_fov| is the size of the axial FOV, 
% |dPitch| is the crystal pitch (size), |sourceToDetector| is the distance from 
% source to the detector (mm), |sourceToCRot| the distance from source to the 
% center of rotation (mm), |horizontalOffset| is an optional value that can be 
% used to specify possible offset of the source from the center of rotation, |bedOffset| 
% is an optional value that describes the offsets of each bed position, |subsets| 
% is the optional number of subsets, |implementation| is the used implementation 
% (3, OpenCL, and 4, OpenMP, are supported), |deviceN| is the platform used when 
% using implementation 3.
% 
% The alternative way, is to use user-computed detector coordinates. The constructor 
% is then: |A = forwardBackwardProjectCT(x,y,z, Nx, Ny, Nz, FOVa_x, axial_fov, 
% subsets, implementation, deviceN)|, where |x|, |y| and |z| are the detector 
% coordinates in the transaxial and axial directions.
% 
% In each of the three cases, the class object can simply be used as |A * x| 
% to compute forward projection and |A' * y| to compute backprojection. Subsets 
% can be set with |A.subset = subset_number|. Alternatively, you can use the class 
% object in function: |forwardProject(A, f, subset_number)| and |backwardProject(A, 
% y, subset_number)|.
% 
% *Extracting the system matrix*
% 
% The class object can also be used to form the system matrix itself, either 
% the entire system matrix or a subset. However, to form the system matrix, the 
% class object has to be created with implementation 1 (e.g. |options.implementation 
% = 1|). The matrix itself is obtained with |B = formMatrix(A, subset_number)|, 
% where |subset_number| can be omitted if the entire system matrix is required.
