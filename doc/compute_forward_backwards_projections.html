%% Computing the forward and/or backward projections
% This page details on how to separately compute the forward and/or backward 
% projections when using OMEGA.
% 
% When you are manually computing the forward and/or backward projections, it 
% is recommended to use the |forward_backward_projections_example.m| and modify 
% it according to your specifications.
% 
% The initial part works very much like |main_PET.m|, however, there are no 
% adjustments for the reconstruction algorithms. You still need to input the necessary 
% information (machine properties, sinogram/raw data properties, corrections, 
% etc.) before proceeding. For |options.precompute_lor = true| you also need to 
% perform the precomputation phase if it hasn't been performed before. 
% 
% For the reconstruction, implementations 1 and 3 are supported with 3 recommended.
% 
% You'll need to run the |index_maker| as specified to get the necessary subset 
% indices. The line |[gaussK, options] = PSFKernel(options);| is only applicable 
% if PSF reconstruction is used as it creates the PSF kernel |gaussK|.
% 
% To use your own measurement data, replace |load('Cylindrical_PET_example_cylpet_example_sinograms_combined_static_200x168x703_span3.mat','raw_SinM')| 
% with your own custom load or simply run the code up to that and manually load 
% your data. You should either name your measurement data as |raw_SinM| or rename 
% all instances of |raw_SinM| to the same name as your input measurement data. 
% Your input data needs to be oriented the same way as the measurement data used 
% in OMEGA. For sinograms that is thus |options.Ndist x options.Nang x options.NSinos|. 
% Dynamic data needs to be manually correctly formatted.
% 
% After the above steps, simply use the functions |forward_project| and |backproject| 
% as you like. The example provided uses them the same way as in OSEM, but as 
% they simply implement the operations _y = Ax_ and _x = A^Tb_, respectively, 
% you can implement any algorithm that uses these matrix-vector operations. An 
% example of PSF reconstruction is included as well. Sensitivity image is obtained 
% with backprojection, but can also be omitted by simply having only one output 
% parameter.
% 
% All selected corrections are applied to the forward and/or backward projections. 
% If you wish to use different projectors for the forward or backward projections, 
% you need to manually set options.projector_type between them. E.g. compute forward 
% projection when |options.projector_type = 2| and then set |options.projector_type 
% = 1| and compute backprojection. This, however, is untested and may especially 
% not work when using implementation 1. If you wish to use different projectors, 
% it is recommended to use implementation 3 and set |options.precompute_lor = 
% false|.
% 
% The optional PSF deblurring phase can also be performed and an example of 
% that is also included.
