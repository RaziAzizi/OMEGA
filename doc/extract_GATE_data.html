%% Extracting GATE scatter, randoms and trues data
% OMEGA allows the import of GATE scatter, randoms and trues data into  MATLAB 
% either in the raw list-mode format, as a sinogram or as a "true"  image depicting 
% the number of counts emanating from each coordinate  (this is converted into 
% same pixel resolution as the reconstructed  image). All three components are 
% stored separately along with the actual coincidence data. The import can be 
% done either by using |gate_main_m| or |gate_main_simple.m|, with the latter 
% only supporting OSEM reconstruction. If you need only the data import, |gate_main_simple.m| 
% is recommended for better readability.
% 
% Randoms are supported by all three formats (ASCII, LMF and ROOT). LMF only 
% supports Compton scattering in the phantom, while ASCII and ROOT  support also 
% Compton scattering in the detector, Rayleigh scattering in  the phantom and 
% Rayleigh scattering in the detector. You can select any  one of these in gate_main.m 
% (options.scatter_components). Trues will be  selected from coincidences that 
% originate from the same event and have  not gone through any scattering (as 
% indicated by the GATE output files).
% 
% _Note: Using ROOT data, as mentioned in _<https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/README.md 
% _readme_>_, will cause MATLAB R2018b and EARLIER to crash during GUI activity. 
% This can be prevented by using MATLAB in the -nojvm mode (i.e. |matlab -nojvm|), 
% which means without any GUIs. It is recommended to use this only for data extraction 
% (set |options.only_sinos = true| and run |gate_main_simple.m|). This issue is 
% not present on Octave or MATLAB R2019a and up. ROOT is not supported on Windows 
% on either MATLAB or Octave. _
% 
% Extracting the trues, randoms and/or scatter has no effect on the  actual 
% coincidences. I.e. they will also be extracted same regardless if any of the 
% trues, randoms or scatter is extracted.
% 
% All coincidences that are from different events (i.e. not from the  same annihilation) 
% will be considered as randoms. All coincidences that  come from the same event 
% but have scattered in at least one of the four  possibilities are considered 
% scatter. All coincidences that originate  from the same event but have not scattered 
% are considered as trues. If a prompt has scattered in any way (any of the four 
% components), it will  not be accepted as a true.
%% Usage
% First block (MACHINE PROPERTIES) needs to be filled with the  parameters corresponding 
% to the machine in question. Components computed from earlier elements (e.g. 
% |det_per_ring|) do not need to be filled (only |gate_main.m|).
% 
% The second block (titled "GATE SPECIFIC SETTINGS") allows the user to specify 
% which elements to extract by setting the appropriate  options-value to true 
% (or 1).
% 
% Setting |options.obtain_trues = true| causes automatic  extraction of trues. 
% You can also (optionally) choose to reconstruct the trues instead of the actual 
% coincidences. This is done by setting |options.reconstruct_trues = true|.
% 
% |options.store_scatter = true| allows the storing of scatter. However, in 
% order to store scatter at least one element in the next vector needs to be 1. 
% |options.scatter_components| stores the different scatter components as mentioned 
% in introduction.  The first one is Compton scattering in the phantom, second 
% Compton  scattering in the detector, this Rayleigh scattering in the phantom 
% and  fourth Rayleigh scattering in the detector. E.g. setting |options.scatter_components 
% = [1 0 1 0]| stores only the Compton and Rayleigh scattering in the phantom, 
% while  scatter in the detectors will be ignored and not included either in the  
% scatter data or trues. As with true data, you can optionally choose to  reconstruct 
% the scatter data by setting |options.reconstruct_scatter = true|. Only one of 
% trues, scatter or coincidences can be reconstructed at the same time.
% 
% Randoms can be obtained by putting |options.store_randoms = true|. The randoms 
% obtained like this will not be used for randoms correction  if it is selected. 
% Both the actual randoms and delayed coincidences (if  selected in GATE) can 
% be extracted at the same time and in separate  variables.
% 
% The "true" image can be optionally stored as well by putting |options.source 
% = true|. This will create a separate mat-file named |machine_name '_Ideal_image_coordinates_' 
% name '_ASCII.mat'|, where |machine_name| is the name of the machine you’ve specified 
% and |name| the name of the examination you’ve specified. The last elements of 
% |C| contains the trues (e.g. |C{end}|), |RA| contains randoms and |SC| scatter. 
% Randoms and scatter are stored as singles in the true images.
% 
% Only ONE of the below output data can be used at a time (e.g. you cannot extract 
% both LMF and ASCII data at the same time).
% 
% If you intent to form sinograms as well, the SINOGRAM PROPERTIES block also 
% needs to be filled with correct values.
% 
% *Using ASCII data*
% 
% In order to extract scatter, randoms and/or trues from ASCII data you need 
% to set |options.use_ASCII = true| in the ASCII DATA FORMAT SETTINGS block. Additionally 
% you need to  copy-paste the ASCII coincidence mask used in your macro. E.g. 
% if |/gate/output/ascii/setCoincidenceMask 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 
% 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0| then |options.coincidence_mask = [0 1 
% 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0];|.
% 
% If you are extracting trues, then ALL the scatter components need to  be selected 
% in the GATE coincidence mask before running the simulation.
% 
% The location of the ASCII .dat files is specified by |options.fpath| in MISC 
% PROPERTIES. Alternatively, the current working directory in MATLAB can be used 
% as well.
% 
% *Using LMF data*
% 
% Set |options.use_LMF = true| and specify the number of  bytes in the LMF header 
% and in each event packet. Additionally, specify  the number of bits dedicated 
% for each detector element (R-sectors,  modules, submodules, crystals, layers, 
% shown when the simulation starts  in GATE) and the coincidence window. Lastly 
% the clock time step shown in cch-files is needed.
% 
% The location of the LMF .ccs files is specified by |options.fpath| in MISC 
% PROPERTIES. Alternatively, the current working directory in MATLAB can be used 
% as well.
% 
% You need to run |install_mex| before LMF support is available.
% 
% _Note: The source image can be unreliable with LMF data. _
% 
% *Using ROOT data*
% 
% Simply set |options.use_root = true|. The location of the ROOT .root files 
% is specified by |options.fpath| in MISC PROPERTIES. Alternatively, the current 
% working directory in MATLAB can be used as well.
% 
% You need to run |install_mex| before ROOT support is available (Linux only). 
% If |thisroot.sh/csh| has been sourced, ROOT should be found automatically. Otherwise 
% you can input the ROOT path with |install_mex(0, [], [], [], '/PATH/TO/ROOT')|.
% 
% _Note: Using ROOT data, as mentioned in _<https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/README.md 
% _readme_>_, will cause MATLAB R2018b and EARLIER to crash during GUI activity. 
% This can be prevented by using MATLAB in the -nojvm mode (i.e. |matlab -nojvm|), 
% which means without any GUIs. It is recommended to use this only for data extraction 
% (set |options.only_sinos = true| and run |gate_main_simple.m|). This issue is 
% not present on Octave or MATLAB R2019a and up. ROOT is not supported on Windows 
% on either MATLAB or Octave. _
% 
% *Loading and saving data*
% 
% The actual data load happens when the third section of gate_main.m is run. 
% You need to run the first section before the third one will work.  This will 
% save the measurement data in a raw form where the coincidences are saved between 
% all the unique possible detector pairs (LORs) in  vector form. E.g. The first 
% element of this vector contains coincidences between detectors 1 and 1 (not 
% actually possible), second between 1 and 2 (also 2 and 1, e.g. reversed), third 
% 1 and 3, etc. There are produced separately for the all the selected elements 
% (random, true, scattered,  coincidences and delayed coincidences) and saved 
% in a mat-file (contains the word *raw*). The raw data is always stored in  cell-arrays, 
% even if static examination is performed. Source images (if  selected) are saved 
% in a separate mat-file.
% 
% Sinograms can be formed of all the above data by running the next section. 
% All the sinograms are saved in mat-file. |raw_SinM| contains the coincidences 
% with no corrections, |SinM| contains the corrected coincidences (if any were 
% selected), |SinDelayed| contains the delayed coincidences, |SinScatter| contains 
% scatter, |SinTrues| trues and |SinRandoms| randoms. These will be cell-files 
% if a dynamic examination is performed.
% 
% *Reconstruction*
% 
% If you wish to reconstruct any data, run the next section  (Reconstructions). 
% The selected data (trues, scatter, coincidences  [default]) will be automatically 
% selected.
% 
% If you want to reconstruct e.g. trues + Compton scatter in phantom,  you should 
% load the saved sinogram/raw data and sum the trues and  Compton scatter together 
% (i.e. if |options.scatter_components = [1 0 0 0]| then |SinScatter| contains 
% only the Compton scatter in phantom and you can perform them reconstructions 
% with the following code |options.SinM = SinTrues + SinScatter|). If |options.SinM| 
% already exists, it will not be loaded from the saved mat-files. That  way you 
% can input any data combinations, but unless you want exclusively trues or scatter, 
% they need to be performed manually now. The same  applies to raw data, but instead 
% of |options.SinM| use |options.coincidences|.
% 
% Currently the user also has to individually extract each scatter  component 
% (i.e. you can’t extract Compton scatter in phantom or in  detector simultaneously 
% in separate variables/data files, but rather  need to extract each component 
% on its own and rename the output data  accordingly).
