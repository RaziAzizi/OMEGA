%% Extracting GATE scatter, randoms and trues data
% OMEGA allows the import of <http://www.opengatecollaboration.org/ GATE> scatter, 
% randoms and trues data into  MATLAB either in the raw data format, as a sinogram 
% or as a "true" image depicting the number of counts emanating from each coordinate 
% (this is  converted into same pixel resolution as the reconstructed image). 
% All  three components (trues, scatter and randoms) are stored separately  along 
% with the actual coincidence (prompts) data. The import can be done either by 
% using |gate_main_m|, |gate_main_simple.m|, or any machine specific main-file. 
% |gate_main_simple.m| supports only OSEM reconstruction. If you need only the 
% data import, |gate_main_simple.m| is recommended for better readability.
% 
% Randoms are supported by all three formats (ASCII, LMF and ROOT). LMF  only 
% supports Compton scattering in the phantom, while ASCII and ROOT  support also 
% Compton scattering in the detector, Rayleigh scattering in  the phantom and 
% Rayleigh scattering in the detector. You can select any  one of these in the 
% main-files (|options.scatter_components|).
% 
% _Note: Using ROOT data, as mentioned in _<https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/README.md 
% _readme_>_, will cause MATLAB R2018b and EARLIER to crash during GUI activity. 
% This can be prevented by using MATLAB in the -nojvm mode (i.e. |matlab -nojvm|), 
% which means without any GUIs. It is recommended to use this only for data extraction 
% (set |options.only_sinos = true| and run |gate_main_simple.m|). This issue is 
% not present on Octave or MATLAB R2019a and up. ROOT is not supported on Windows 
% on either MATLAB or Octave. _
% 
% Extracting the trues, randoms and/or scatter has no effect on the  actual 
% coincidences (prompts). I.e. they will also be extracted same  regardless if 
% any of the trues, randoms or scatter is extracted.
% 
% All coincidences that are from different events (i.e. not from the  same annihilation) 
% will be considered as randoms. All coincidences that  come from the same event 
% but have scattered in at least one of the four  possibilities are considered 
% scatter. For trues, it is possible to  control on which coincidences are considered 
% trues. Randoms and Compton  scattered events in the phantom are ALWAYS excluded 
% from trues, but the  other three are excluded ONLY if they are selected in |options.scatter_components|. 
% E.g. if |options.scatter_components = [1 1 0 0]| then Rayleigh scattered events 
% are included in trues, but not in scattered events.
% 
% For scattered events, the scattering in the phantom takes precedence. For 
% example, if an event has Compton scattered in the phantom and in  the detector, 
% it is included ONLY in the Compton scattered events in the phantom. Compton 
% scattering also takes precedence over Rayleigh  scattering. The order is thus 
% Compton scattering in the phantom →  Compton scattering in the detector → Rayleigh 
% scattering in the phantom → Rayleigh scattering in the detector.
% 
% For scattered events, it is also possible to select only multiply  scattered 
% events. For example, only Compton scattered events in the  phantom that have 
% scatted twice or more can be included in the scatter data.
%% Usage
% First block (MACHINE PROPERTIES) needs to be filled with the  parameters corresponding 
% to the machine in question. Components computed from earlier elements (e.g. 
% |det_per_ring|) do not need to be filled (only |gate_main.m|).
% 
% The second block (titled "GATE SPECIFIC SETTINGS") allows the user to specify 
% which elements to extract by setting the appropriate  options-value to true 
% (or 1).
% 
% Setting |options.obtain_trues = true| causes automatic  extraction of trues. 
% You can also (optionally) choose to reconstruct the trues instead of the actual 
% coincidences. This is done by setting |options.reconstruct_trues = true|.
% 
% |options.store_scatter = true| allows the storing of scatter. However, in 
% order to store scatter at least one element in the next vector needs to be 1. 
% |options.scatter_components| stores the different scatter components as mentioned 
% in introduction.  The first one is Compton scattering in the phantom, second 
% Compton  scattering in the detector, this Rayleigh scattering in the phantom 
% and  fourth Rayleigh scattering in the detector. E.g. setting |options.scatter_components 
% = [1 0 1 0]| stores only the Compton and Rayleigh scattering in the phantom, 
% while  scatter in the detectors will be ignored and not included either in the  
% scatter data or trues. As with true data, you can optionally choose to  reconstruct 
% the scatter data by setting |options.reconstruct_scatter = true|. Only one of 
% trues, scatter or coincidences can be reconstructed at the same time.
% 
% Randoms can be obtained by putting |options.store_randoms = true|. The randoms 
% obtained like this will not be used for randoms correction  if it is selected. 
% Both the actual randoms and delayed coincidences (if  selected in GATE) can 
% be extracted at the same time and in separate  variables.
% 
% The "true" image can be optionally stored as well by putting |options.source 
% = true|. This will create a separate mat-file named |machine_name '_Ideal_image_coordinates_' 
% name '_ASCII.mat'|, where |machine_name| is the name of the machine you’ve specified 
% and |name| the name of the examination you’ve specified. The last elements of 
% |C| contains the trues (e.g. |C{end}|), |RA| contains randoms and |SC| scatter. 
% Randoms and scatter are stored as singles in the true images.
% 
% Only ONE of the below output data can be used at a time (e.g. you cannot extract 
% both LMF and ASCII data at the same time).
% 
% If you intent to form sinograms as well, the SINOGRAM PROPERTIES block also 
% needs to be filled with correct values.
% 
% *Using ASCII data*
% 
% In order to extract scatter, randoms and/or trues from ASCII data you need 
% to set |options.use_ASCII = true| in the ASCII DATA FORMAT SETTINGS block. Additionally 
% you need to  copy-paste the ASCII coincidence mask used in your macro. E.g. 
% if |/gate/output/ascii/setCoincidenceMask 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 
% 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0| then |options.coincidence_mask = [0 1 
% 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0];|.
% 
% If you are extracting trues, then ALL the scatter components need to  be selected 
% in the GATE coincidence mask before running the simulation.
% 
% The location of the ASCII .dat files is specified by |options.fpath| in MISC 
% PROPERTIES. Alternatively, the current working directory in MATLAB can be used 
% as well.
% 
% *Using LMF data*
% 
% Set |options.use_LMF = true| and specify the number of  bytes in the LMF header 
% and in each event packet. Additionally, specify  the number of bits dedicated 
% for each detector element (R-sectors,  modules, submodules, crystals, layers, 
% shown when the simulation starts  in GATE) and the coincidence window. Lastly 
% the clock time step shown in cch-files is needed.
% 
% The location of the LMF .ccs files is specified by |options.fpath| in MISC 
% PROPERTIES. Alternatively, the current working directory in MATLAB can be used 
% as well.
% 
% You need to run |install_mex| before LMF support is available.
% 
% _Note: The source image can be unreliable with LMF data. _
% 
% *Using ROOT data*
% 
% Simply set |options.use_root = true|. The location of the ROOT .root files 
% is specified by |options.fpath| in MISC PROPERTIES. Alternatively, the current 
% working directory in MATLAB can be used as well.
% 
% You need to run |install_mex| before ROOT support is available (Linux only). 
% If |thisroot.sh/csh| has been sourced, ROOT should be found automatically. Otherwise 
% you can input the ROOT path with |install_mex(0, [], [], [], '/PATH/TO/ROOT')|.
% 
% _Note: Using ROOT data, as mentioned in _<https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/README.md 
% _readme_>_, will cause MATLAB R2018b and EARLIER to crash during GUI activity. 
% This can be prevented by using MATLAB in the -nojvm mode (i.e. |matlab -nojvm|), 
% which means without any GUIs. It is recommended to use this only for data extraction 
% (set |options.only_sinos = true| and run |gate_main_simple.m|). This issue is 
% not present on Octave or MATLAB R2019a and up. ROOT is not supported on Windows 
% on either MATLAB or Octave. _
% 
% *Loading and saving data*
% 
% Sinograms are automatically created during data load regardless of the type 
% of data used. Raw data is stored if |options.store_raw_data = true|. These are 
% also automatically saved into a mat-file in the current  working directory. 
% If you are using TOF data, all the trues, scatter and randoms sinograms will 
% be TOF as well.
% 
% *Reconstruction*
% 
% If you wish to reconstruct any data, run the next section  (Reconstructions). 
% The selected data (trues, scatter, coincidences  [default]) will be automatically 
% selected.
% 
% If you want to reconstruct e.g. trues (without any scattered  coincidences) 
% + Compton scatter in phantom, you should load the saved  sinogram/raw data and 
% sum the trues and Compton scatter together (i.e.  if |options.scatter_components 
% = [1 0 0 0]| then |SinScatter| contains only the Compton scatter in phantom 
% and you can perform them reconstructions with the following code |options.SinM 
% = SinTrues + SinScatter|). If |options.SinM| already exists, it will not be 
% loaded from the saved mat-files. That  way you can input any data combinations, 
% but unless you want exclusively trues or scatter, they need to be performed 
% manually now. The same  applies to raw data, but instead of |options.SinM| use 
% |options.coincidences|. Note that in this example case you need to obtain the 
% scatter data and  trues data separately since the trues will include the other 
% scattered  components if the scatter components is |options.scatter_components 
% = [1 0 0 0]|, i.e. trues should be obtained with |options.scatter_components 
% = [1 1 1 1]|.
% 
% Currently the user also has to individually extract each scatter  component 
% (i.e. you can’t extract Compton scatter in phantom or in  detector simultaneously 
% in separate variables/data files, but rather  need to extract each component 
% on its own and rename the output data  accordingly).
