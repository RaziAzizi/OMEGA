The corresponding function will output the corrected measurement data, the normalization matrix (multiplying this with the original measurement data gives the same corrected data) and each individual correction factors. Computation of the normalization coefficients follows the book [</span><a href = "https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references"><span style=' text-decoration: underline;'>1</span></a><span>].

This file can be either a mat-file with one variable (the normalization coefficients, such that normalized_data = un_normalized_data * normalization) or an Inveon PET .nrm-file. In the latter case, the file needs to be exactly as output by the Siemens software.</span></div><div  class = 'S5'><span style=' font-weight: bold;'>Arc correction (arc_correction)</span><span> = Applies arc correction to the input sinogram data.

By default </span><span style=' font-family: monospace;'>scatteredInterpolant</span><span> is used, but if the method is not supported by it </span><span style=' font-family: monospace;'>gridddata</span><span> is used. </span><span style=' font-family: monospace;'>griddata</span><span> is also used if </span><span style=' font-family: monospace;'>scatteredInterpolant</span><span> is not found.</span></div><div  class = 'S5'><span style=' font-weight: bold;'>Apply corrections during reconstruction (corrections_during_reconstruction)</span><span> = If set to true, then the corrections are applied during the reconstruction phase. I.e. uncorrected sinogram/raw data is automatically loaded and used in the reconstruction process. The corrections data is also automatically loaded (assuming it has been previously created). Smoothing and/or variance reduction are performed beforehand.

This value multiplied with the above  TOF bins should be, at most, the size of the coincidence window.</span></div><div  class = 'S5'><span style=' font-weight: bold;'>TOF offset (TOF_offset)</span><span> = Offset value (in seconds)  for TOF data. In case your TOF bins are not centered in zero use this  value to offset the values towards positive or negative bins. In the  case of Biograph mCT and Vision this is automatically filled for the  list-mode data. If using simulated GATE data, no offset is required in  any case by default nor is this value used to offset the data (this has  to be done manually currently if needed).</span></div><div  class = 'S5'><span style=' font-weight: bold;'>FWHM of the temporal noise/FWHM of the TOF data (TOF_noise_FWHM)</span><span> = This value has two different purposes, first one applies to ALL data  saved by OMEGA while the second only to GATE data. The first purpose is  in naming the TOF data and thus also used when loading the data. In this case it tells the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the temporal  (TOF) resolution of the data (in seconds). The second purpose is to add  additional temporal noise to the GATE data with the specified FWHM (in  seconds). This is recommended when you have not added any temporal  blurring in GATE itself. If you have added temporal blurring in GATE, it is recommended to set this to zero unless you wish to add additional  temporal noise.</span></div><div  class = 'S5'><span style=' font-weight: bold;'>FWHM of the TOF data (TOF_FWHM)</span><span> = This is the FWHM  of the TOF data (in seconds) used purely for reconstruction purposes and as such does NOT need to be the same as the above value. In fact in  practically all cases the actual FWHM of the data should always differ  from the above one. One way to determine the actual FWHM is to simulate a point source.</span></div><div  class = 'S5'><span style=' font-weight: bold;'>Number of TOF bins used in (TOF_bins_used)</span><span> = This  specifies how many TOF bins are actually used during the reconstruction  phase. Currently this has to be either same as the total number of bins  or 1 (in which case all TOF bins are summed together). In the future,  this will allow TOF mashing.</span></div><h2  class = 'S4' id = 'H_49BA64C8' ><span>MISCELLANEOUS PROPERTIES</span></h2><div  class = 'S5'><span style=' font-weight: bold;'>Name (name)</span><span> = Name of the experiment/simulation/whatever (char).

All the files for the specified GATE output will be read. E.g. if you set use_ASCII to true, then from the folder specified by fpath, all the .dat files with Coincidences in them will be loaded, for LMF all .ccs files will be loaded and for Root all .root files will be loaded. If you use Windows, use the </span><span style=' font-family: monospace;'>fpat</span><span> value after </span><span style=' font-family: monospace;'>ispc</span><span>, otherwise the one after </span><span style=' font-family: monospace;'>else</span><span>.</span></div><div  class = 'S5'><span style=' font-weight: bold;'>Form only sinograms (only_sinos)</span><span> = If this is set to true, then running the m-file only performs steps up to the sinogram formation. I.e. data is loaded and then the sinogram is formed. No reconstructions, normalization coefficient computations or precomputations will be done.</span></div><div  class = 'S5'><span style=' font-weight: bold;'>No input data load (no_data_load)</span><span> = If set to true, then all other sections/phases are run normally except for the data load which is NOT performed.</span></div><div  class = 'S5'><span style=' font-weight: bold;'>Precompute the observation/system matrix (precompute_obs_matrix)</span><span> = Experimental feature. Setting to true computes the entire system matrix on one go and will most likely require a significant amount of memory (most likely over 100 GB). Supports only MLEM reconstruction. If set to false, then the system matrix is calculated on-the-fly (recommended).</span></div><div  class = 'S5'><span style=' font-weight: bold;'>Only reconstructions (only_reconstruction)</span><span> = Setting to true skips all other steps except the reconstruction phase. Precompute step is also skipped even if set to true. All necessary data is loaded from the previously computed mat-files.

I.e. data that has not been compressed at all. This step requires its own precompute phase if </span><span style=' font-family: monospace;'>options.precompute_lor = true</span><span>. The raw data in OMEGA is formatted such that the saved measurement data is a vector formed from a lower triangular matrix. This lower triangular matrix is extracted from a matrix of size </span><span style=' font-family: monospace;'>total_number_of_detectors x total_number_of_detectors</span><span>. The matrix contains all the possible line of response combinations, e.g. between detector 1 and detector 3. Since the LOR between detectors 1 and 3 is the same as the LOR between detectors 3 and 1, the upper triangular part is added to the lower triangular part before the lower triangular part is extracted. The raw date is always saved in cell format, regardless of the number of time steps. Non-cell data should work, but cell data is recommended.</span></div><div  class = 'S5'><span style=' font-weight: bold;'>How many pixels a LOR traverses (precompute_lor)</span><span> = When true, this option changes the reconstruction process quite radically. First, it requires its own precompute phase. Secondly, it affects greatly on how the system matrix is formed. With this option set to true, the number of pixels each LOR traverses is determined beforehand. For implementation 1 this allows for more efficient memory management, while with other methods the computational speed is enhanced (more for raw data). This step is HIGHLY recommended if you use implementation 1. Improved Siddon’s algorithm with more than 1 ray is not supported when this is true.</span></div><div  class = 'S5'><span style=' font-weight: bold;'>Precompute everything (precompute_all)</span><span> = This option causes the prepass phase to compute all mat-files even if they were not selected.

Implementation 3, however, only supports OSEM and MLEM. Unlike implementation 2, implementation 3 does support multi-device computation. The multi-device computation consists using of multiple GPUs (from the same manufacturer) or using GPU + CPU combination (from the same manufacturer).</span></div><div  class = 'S5'><span>If set to 4, then all the computations are done parallel on the CPU by using OpenMP (if supported by the compiler). This is a matrix-free method. This implementation does not require OpenCL and should work on all CPUs. All CPUs/cores are used automatically. All algorithms except MRAMLA and MBSREM are supported. All priors are supported. Only one MLEM-based algorithm and one OS-based algorithm are supported (with one prior) at a time.

This affects ONLY implementations 2 and 3. If your device does not support 64-bit atomics, the result will be equivalent to setting this to false (with slightly slower overall computations due to extra compilation). Intel hardware usually do not support 64-bit atomics, but AMD or Nvidia GPUs should. Setting this to false will cause slower computations if the 64-bit atomics are supported but can be slightly more reliable and accurate. This is recommended when using GPUs and OpenCL.</span></div><div  class = 'S5'><span style=' font-weight: bold;'>Use CUDA</span><span> = If true, uses CUDA code for implementation 2 instead of OpenCL.

%% MACHINE PROPERTIES
% The first section contains the device parameters and is included in both files. 
% These include (name in parenthesis is the MATLAB variable name):
% 
% *Blocks per ring (blocks_per_ring)* = This is the number of "blocks" in your 
% machine on each ring. If you have cylindrical PET geometry, then this should 
% be the number of R-sectors/modules per ring. For ECAT it is the number of blocks/R-sectors. 
% If you need more help, see the included example (# R E P E A T R S E C T O R).
% 
% *Linear multiply (linear_multip)* = The repeater number in GATE. See the example 
% on how this compares with the GATE macros (# R E P E A T M O D U L E). For non-GATE 
% it is the number of blocks in axial direction.
% 
% *Crystals per block (cryst_per_block)* = The number of crystals on the side 
% of each block. In the example the crystals are in 8x8 grids meaning this value 
% is 8. Blocks need to contain square crystal grids.
% 
% *Crystal pitch x/y-direction (cr_p)* = Crystal pitch in the x- and y-directions. 
% I.e. the distance between the centers of adjacent crystals.
% 
% *Crystal pitch z-direction (cr_pz)* = Same as above, but in z-direction.
% 
% *Bore diameter (diameter)* = Diameter of the machine bore. I.e. distance between 
% perpendicular crystals.
% 
% *Transaxial field-of-view (FOVa_x)* = Transaxial field-of-view (x-direction), 
% i.e. the reconstructed image location.
% 
% *Transaxial field-of-view (FOVa_y)* = Transaxial field-of-view (y-direction), 
% i.e. the reconstructed image location.
% 
% *Axial FOV (axial_fov)* = Same as above, but in axial (z) direction.
% 
% *Pseudo rings (pseudot)* = The number of pseudo rings. Use 0 or [] if none.
% 
% *Detectors per ring (det_per_ring)* = Number of detectors per ring without 
% pseudo detectors. Can be automatically determined as in the example.
% 
% *Detectors per ring w/ pseudo detectors (det_w_pseudo)* = Same as above, but 
% with pseudo detectors included. Since pseudo detectors are usually included 
% in each detector block, you can determine this number by adding +1 to crystals 
% per block. E.g. |options.det_w_pseudo = options.blocks_per_ring*(options.cryst_per_block 
% + 1);|
% 
% *Total number of rings (rings)* = Number of crystal rings. Can be computed 
% automatically.
% 
% *Total number of detectors (detectors)* = Can be automatically determined.
% 
% *Machine name* = The name of your machine. Used for naming purposes.
%% GATE SPECIFIC SETTINGS
% *Obtain trues (obtain_trues)* = If this is set to true, then the true coincidences 
% are extracted separately from the GATE data. In order to obtain trues with ASCII 
% or LMF format data, you need to enable event ID and scatter counts in the output. 
% See the example macro <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/exampleGATE/benchPET.mac#L46 
% benchPET.mac>. Initially the trues are obtained in the raw data format, but 
% they can be transformed into sinogram format. True coincidences are coincidences 
% without any random or scattered coincidences.
% 
% *Reconstruct trues (reconstruct_trues)* = If this is set to true, then the 
% true coincidences are used in the image reconstruction automatically. Requires 
% an existing trues data file (sinogram or raw data).
% 
% *Store scatter (store_scatter) *= If this is set to true, then the scattered 
% coincidences are extracted separately from the GATE data. In order to obtain 
% scatter data with ASCII or LMF format data, you need to enable scatter counts 
% in the output. See the example macro <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/exampleGATE/benchPET.mac#L46 
% benchPET.mac>. Initially the scatter data are obtained in the raw data format, 
% but they can be transformed into sinogram format. The user can specify which 
% scatter components to include, see below. This data is not used for scatter 
% correction.
% 
% *Scatter components (scatter_components)* = A vector for each of the FOUR 
% available scatter components. GATE supports the following different scatter 
% components: Compton scattering in the phantom, Compton scattering in the detector 
% crystal, Rayleigh scattering in the phantom and Rayleigh scattering in the detector 
% crystal. Each component can be enabled by setting the corresponding vector value 
% to 1. E.g. If you would want both Compton and Rayleigh scattering in the phantom 
% (but not in the detector crystal) set this as |options.scatter_components = 
% [1 0 1 0];|. By default, all four are enabled. This variable only works if |options.store_scatter 
% = tru|e.
% 
% *Reconstruct scatter (reconstruct_scatter)* = As with trues, when set to true 
% then the scattered coincidences are used in the image reconstruction automatically. 
% Requires an existing scatter data file (sinogram or raw data). Trues take precedence 
% over scatter, i.e. if both this and trues are set to true, then only trues are 
% reconstructed. 
% 
% *Store randoms (store_randoms)* = If this is set to true, then the true random 
% coincidences are extracted separately from the GATE data. In order to obtain 
% scatter data with ASCII or LMF format data, you need to enable event ID in the 
% output. See the example macro <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/exampleGATE/benchPET.mac#L46 
% benchPET.mac>. Initially the randoms data are obtained in the raw data format, 
% but they can be transformed into sinogram format. This includes all coincidences 
% that do not share the same event ID. These counts are not used for randoms correction; 
% delayed coincidences can be used for randoms correction.
% 
% *Obtain source coordinates (source)* = If this is set to true, then the source 
% coordinates of all the coincidences are saved in separate variable(s) and stored 
% in mat-file. These can then be used to form the original decay image. Separate 
% matrices are created for all different cases (prompts, trues, scatter and randoms) 
% if any of them have been selected. E.g. if |store_trues = true|, then the source 
% image containing only the coordinates of the true coincidences are saved. Scatter 
% and randoms are stored as singles, trues as coincidences (only one count at 
% each coordinate) and prompts both as coincidences and singles.
% 
% NOTE: Source coordinates obtained from LMF data can be unreliable.
% ASCII DATA FORMAT SETTINGS
% *use ASCII (use_ASCII)* = True if you want to use GATE ASCII files as input 
% data, false if you want to use LMF or ROOT.
% 
% *Coincidence mask (coincidence_mask)* = This is the ASCII coincidence mask 
% used in GATE macros. Simply copy-paste the number part of the mask to MATLAB 
% inside brackets. E.g. if |/gate/output/ascii/setCoincidenceMask 0 1 0 1 1 1 
% 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0|, then |options.coincidence_mask 
% = [0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0];|. 
% If you have not used a coincidence mask, use an empty array (i.e.| options.coincidence_mask 
% = []|;).
% LMF DATA FORMAT SETTINGS
% *use LMF (use_LMF)* = True if you want to use GATE LMF files as input data, 
% false if you want to use ASCII or ROOT.
% 
% *Number of header bytes (header_bytes)* = How many bytes are dedicated for 
% LMF header.
% 
% *Number of event bytes (data_bytes)* = How many bytes are at each event packet. 
% Currently this can be at most 21 (time + detector indices + source indices + 
% event indices + number of Compton in phantom) and has to be at least 10 (time 
% + detector indices).
% 
% *Number of bits used for R-sectors (R_bits)* = How many bits in the 16-bit 
% index packet are dedicated for R-sectors. This can be seen when the simulation 
% starts.
% 
% *Number of bits used for modules, submodules, crystal and layers (M_bits, 
% etc.)* = Same as above. Although submodules are not supported or used, they 
% should use at least 1 bit.
% 
% *Coincidence window length (coincidence_window)* = Length of the coincidence 
% window in seconds.
% 
% *Source coordinates (source_LMF)* = Are source coordinates obtained? Set to 
% true if you want to save the "true" image. |data_bytes| needs to be at least 
% 16 if this is set to true. |data_bytes| can be 16 even if this is false if source 
% coordinates were saved during the simulation.
% 
% *Clock time step (clock_time_step)* = What is the clock time step. This should 
% the clock time step from the cch-files. E.g. if clock time step is 1 ps (1e-12) 
% in cch-files then this would be 1e-12.
% ROOT DATA FORMAT SETTINGS
% *use ROOT (use_root)* = True if you want to use GATE ROOT files as input data, 
% false if you want to use ASCII or LMF.
%% IMAGE PROPERTIES
% *Image size in x-direction (Nx)* = If the total image size is 128x128x63 then 
% this is 128. 
% 
% *Image size in y-direction (Ny)* = If the total image size is 128x128x63 then 
% this is 128. 
% 
% *Image size in z-direction (Nz)* = If the total image size is 128x128x63 then 
% this is 63.
% 
% *Flip image* = Flips the image in vertical direction (before reconstruction, 
% e.g. flips the detector coordinates).
% 
% *Image rotation (offangle)* = How much is the image rotated. This is performed 
% before reconstruction and shifts the detector coordinates with the specified 
% amount. Due to this, this should be a certain percentage of the total number 
% of detectors on one ring (|det_per_ring|).
%% RAW DATA PROPERTIES
% *Maximum ring difference (ring_difference_raw)* = The maximum distance (in 
% rings) from which LORs are included, when using raw list-mode data.
% 
% *Increasing raw data sampling (sampling_raw)* = Interpolates additional rows 
% and columns to the raw data. If this is set to two, it will double the size 
% of the raw data in each dimension. Has to be 1 or divisible by 2. Can be used 
% to prevent aliasing artifacts, but will increase memory usage and computation 
% time.
% 
% *Sampling interpolation type (sampling_interpolation_method_raw)* = Specifies 
% the interpolation method used for increased sampling. All methods supported 
% by |interp2| are available.
%% SINOGRAM PROPERTIES
% *Span (span)* = The span factor (also called axial compression). The higher 
% the number, the greater the compression of oblique LORs).
% 
% *Maximum ring difference (ring_difference)* = The maximum distance (in rings) 
% from which oblique LORs are included.
% 
% *Number of angles (Nang)* = How many different angles (tangential positions) 
% are in the sinogram. The angles depict the angle between the LOR and x-axis. 
% Is mashing is used, this value should be the final sinogram size AFTER mashing.
% 
% *Number of views (Ndist)* = How many different views (angular positions) are 
% in the sinogram. The views are the shortest (orthogonal) distance between the 
% LOR and the origin.
% 
% *Segment table (segment_table)* = Oblique sinograms are divided into groups 
% specified by the segment table. This value depends on the span value and can 
% be automatically computed as in the example.
% 
% *Total number of sinograms (TotSinos)* = The total number of sinograms. Can 
% be obtained by summing the segment table.
% 
% *Number of sinograms used in reconstruction (NSinos)* = Less sinograms can 
% be used in the reconstruction process itself (e.g. only parallel LORs). This 
% is an experimental feature. Only the N first sinograms can be used, e.g. you 
% can’t pick only 100 last sinograms, but you can pick the first 100.
% 
% *Distance side (ndist_side)* = When Ndist value is even, then one extra view 
% has to be taken either from the "negative" or "positive" side. With this you 
% can specify whether this is from the "negative" (+1) or "positive" (-1). If 
% you are unsure what value to use, use the default value. This varies from device 
% to device. If you compare the sinogram produced by OMEGA to the machine generated 
% one and see a slight shift, then this parameter is most likely incorrect.
% 
% *Increasing sinogram sampling (sampling)* = The first dimension of the sinogram 
% (views) can be increased with this value. For example setting sampling to 2, 
% would double the size of the first dimension. The extra values are interpolated 
% (see below). This can be used to prevent aliasing artifacts. Value should be 
% either 1 or divisible by two.
% 
% *Sampling interpolation type (sampling_interpolation_method)* = Specifies 
% the interpolation method used for increased sampling. All methods supported 
% by |interp1| are available.
% 
% *Fill sinogram gaps (fill_sinogram_gaps)* = If pseudo detectors are used, 
% setting this to true will fill the gaps caused by them. Experimental feature.
% 
% *Gap filling method (gap_filling_method)* = What method is used to fill the 
% gaps. Available methods are the MATLAB’s built-in |fillmissing| or alternatively 
% <https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4551-inpaint_nans |inpaint_nans|> 
% from file exchange. Must be in char format.
% 
% *Interpolation method (fillmissing) (interpolation_method_fillmissing)* = 
% Which of the interpolation methods are used when using |fillmissing| for gap 
% filling. See the help file on |fillmissing| for more information. Input is char, 
% e.g. |'linear'|.
% 
% *Interpolation method (inpaint_nans) (interpolation_method_inpaint)* = Which 
% of the interpolation methods are used when using |inpaint_nans| for gap filling. 
% See the help on |inpaint_nans| for more information. Input is a number.
%% CORRECTIONS
% *Randoms correction (randoms_correction)* = If set to true, then the delayed 
% coincidences are stored during data load (GATE and Inveon data) and used for 
% randoms correction during sinogram formation or image reconstruction. For other 
% data, the user will be prompted for the randoms correction data when it is required. 
% The data (mat-file) should then include a variable named SinDelayed (sinogram 
% data), delayed_coincidences (raw_data) or be the only variable in the file.
% 
% *Variance reduction (variance_reduction)* = If true, performs variance reduction 
% to randoms data before corrections. The variance reduction uses 3D fan sum algorithm 
% [<https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references 3>].
% 
% *Randoms smoothing (randoms_smoothing)* = If true, performs smoothing to the 
% randoms data before corrections. The smoothing is a fixed 8x8 moving mean smoothing. 
% The window size can be adjusted in the original function |randoms_smoothing|. 
% For sinogram data, the smoothing is done when the randoms sinogram is formed. 
% Activating smoothing later and performing the corrections during reconstructions 
% does NOT perform smoothing unless the sinogram formation step is done as well.
% 
% *Scatter correction (scatter_correction)* = If set to true, scatter correction 
% will be performed during sinogram formation or image reconstruction. In all 
% cases, the user will be prompted for the scatter correction data. The input 
% data (mat-file) must include a variable named SinScatter (sinogram data), scattered_coincidences 
% (raw data) or be the only variable in the file. In the first two cases, the 
% data can be scatter data created by OMEGA from a different MC scatter correction 
% simulation.
% 
% *Scatter variance reduction (scatter_variance_reduction)* = If true, performs 
% variance reduction to scatter data before corrections. 
% 
% *Normalize scatter (normalize_scatter)* = If set to true, performs normalization 
% correction to the scatter correction data before the reconstruction phase. This 
% phase is ignored if the corrections are applied directly to the measured data 
% in which case it will be subtracted before the normalization correction.
% 
% *Scatter smoothing (scatter_smoothing)* = If true, performs smoothing to the 
% scatter data before corrections. The smoothing is a fixed 8x8 moving mean smoothing. 
% The window size can be adjusted in the original function |randoms_smoothing|.
% 
% *Subtract scatter data (subtract_scatter)* = If true, then the scatter data 
% are subtracted from the sinogram/raw data or the forward projection, depending 
% on whether the corrections are applied before reconstruction or during it. If 
% false, the scatter data is instead multiplied with the sinogram/raw data or 
% the system matrix elements. The multiplication case can be considered as the 
% scatter data included in the system matrix itself as a diagonal matrix, where 
% the input scatter data is placed on the diagonal.
% 
% *Attenuation correction (attenuation_correction)* = If true, performs attenuation 
% correction during the reconstruction. You need attenuation images scaled to 
% 511 keV for this. CT images can be scaled with the function |attenuationCT_to_511| 
% provided with OMEGA. DICOM CT images might automatically scale with |create_atten_matrix_CT|, 
% but currently it has been tested only with one machine. |attenuation122_to_511| 
% can be used to scale 122 keV blank/transmission data to 511 keV, i.e. GE-68 
% attenuation measurement.
% 
% *Attenuation datafile (attenuation_datafile)* = Name of the data file containing 
% the (scaled) attenuation images. Use full path if it is not on MATLAB/Octave 
% path. This is required if the attenuation correction is applied. One exception 
% is if you are using Inveon data and have an atn-file, you can then leave this 
% one blank and will be asked separately to input the atn-data.
% 
% *Compute normalization coefficients (compute_normalization)* = If true and 
% the main-file is run, then the input data will be used to compute the normalization 
% coefficients. Currently supported normalization correction components are axial 
% geometric correction (axial block profile and geometric factors), detector efficiency 
% (fan-sum algorithm for both sinogram and raw data or SPC for raw data), transaxial 
% block profile correction and transaxial geometric correction. Supports both 
% raw list-mode data or sinogram data. Transaxial geometric correction is not 
% recommended for objects that do not cover the entire FOV (or rather do not irradiate 
% the entire FOV region). The corresponding function will output the corrected 
% measurement data, the normalization matrix (multiplying this with the original 
% measurement data gives the same corrected data) and each individual correction 
% factors. Computation of the normalization coefficients follows the book [<https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references 
% 1>]. Fan-sum algorithm, used in computing the detector efficiencies, can be 
% found from [<https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references 
% 2>].
% 
% *Normalization options (normalization_options)* = A vector representing all 
% the four possible normalization correction steps that can be performed (see 
% above). 1 means that the method is included, 0 that it is excluded. E.g. the 
% default setting |[1 1 1 0] |computes axial geometric, detector efficiency and 
% transaxial block profile corrections, but not transaxial geometric correction.
% 
% *Phantom radius (normalization_phantom_radius)* = If the source phantom is 
% cylinder that is smaller than the FOV, input the radius of the cylinder here 
% (in cm). For an object encompassing the entire FOV, use an empty array |[]| 
% or |inf|.
% 
% *Attenuation (phantom_attenuation) *= Specify the attenuation coefficient 
% of the phantom material used for normalization measurements. If no attenuation 
% is needed then use an empty array []. If the phantom radius is inf, this value 
% is ignored.
% 
% *Scatter correction (normalization_scatter_correction)* = If a phantom, that 
% is smaller than the FOV, is used, compute the scatter correction for the data. 
% Requires the above cylinder radius and only supports sinogram data. For GATE 
% data it is recommended to use trues in the normalization correction in order 
% to skip this phase.
% 
% *Apply normalization (normalization_correction)* = Once the normalization 
% correction coefficients have been separately computed, turning this to true 
% will enable them in the sinogram formation or in the reconstruction phase.
% 
% *Apply user normalization (use_user_normalization)* = If this is true, then 
% the user will be prompted for the normalization correction data. This file can 
% be either a mat-file with one variable (the normalization coefficients, such 
% that normalized_data = un_normalized_data * normalization) or an Inveon PET 
% .nrm-file. In the latter case, the file needs to be exactly as output by the 
% Siemens software.
% 
% *Arc correction (arc_correction)* = Applies arc correction to the input sinogram 
% data. For the interpolation method, see below. Works only when used without 
% precomputation phase.
% 
% *Arc correction interpolation (arc_interpolation)* = Method used in the arc 
% correction interpolation. All methods supported either by |scatteredInterpolant| 
% or |griddata| are available. By default |scatteredInterpolant| is used, but 
% if the method is not supported by it |gridddata| is used. |griddata| is also 
% used if |scatteredInterpolant| is not found.
% 
% *Apply corrections during reconstruction (corrections_during_reconstruction)* 
% = If set to true, then the corrections are applied during the reconstruction 
% phase. I.e. uncorrected sinogram/raw data is automatically loaded and used in 
% the reconstruction process. The corrections data is also automatically loaded 
% (assuming it has been previously created). Smoothing and/or variance reduction 
% are performed beforehand. This corresponds to the ordinary Poisson case.
%% DYNAMIC IMAGING PROPERTIES
% *Total time (tot_time)* = The total time of the experiment (seconds). If you 
% have a static experiment, use inf to load all the data regardless of the total 
% time.
% 
% *Number of time step (partitions)* = How many time steps are in the dynamic 
% case. Currently all time steps have equal length. Use 1 for static case.
% 
% *Start time (start)* = The start time for the data load (seconds). Any measurements 
% before this time will be ignored and will not be loaded.
% 
% *End time (end)* = The end time for the data load (seconds). Any measurements 
% after this time will be ignored and will not be loaded.
%% TOF PROPERTIES
% Total number of TOF bins (TOF_bins) = The total  number of TOF bins in the 
% TOF data file or, when using GATE data, also  the number of TOF bins you wish 
% to have in the saved data. Sinogram data ONLY.
% 
% *Length of each TOF bin (TOF_width)* = The  width/length of each of the TOF 
% bins (in seconds). Currently all TOF  bins need to be of equal length. This 
% value multiplied with the above  TOF bins should be, at most, the size of the 
% coincidence window.
% 
% *TOF offset (TOF_offset)* = Offset value (in seconds)  for TOF data. In case 
% your TOF bins are not centered in zero use this  value to offset the values 
% towards positive or negative bins. In the  case of Biograph mCT and Vision this 
% is automatically filled for the  list-mode data. If using simulated GATE data, 
% no offset is required in  any case by default nor is this value used to offset 
% the data (this has  to be done manually currently if needed).
% 
% *FWHM of the temporal noise/FWHM of the TOF data (TOF_noise_FWHM)* = This 
% value has two different purposes, first one applies to ALL data  saved by OMEGA 
% while the second only to GATE data. The first purpose is  in naming the TOF 
% data and thus also used when loading the data. In this case it tells the full 
% width at half maximum (FWHM) of the temporal  (TOF) resolution of the data (in 
% seconds). The second purpose is to add  additional temporal noise to the GATE 
% data with the specified FWHM (in  seconds). This is recommended when you have 
% not added any temporal  blurring in GATE itself. If you have added temporal 
% blurring in GATE, it is recommended to set this to zero unless you wish to add 
% additional  temporal noise.
% 
% *FWHM of the TOF data (TOF_FWHM)* = This is the FWHM  of the TOF data (in 
% seconds) used purely for reconstruction purposes and as such does NOT need to 
% be the same as the above value. In fact in  practically all cases the actual 
% FWHM of the data should always differ  from the above one. One way to determine 
% the actual FWHM is to simulate a point source.
% 
% *Number of TOF bins used in (TOF_bins_used)* = This  specifies how many TOF 
% bins are actually used during the reconstruction  phase. Currently this has 
% to be either same as the total number of bins  or 1 (in which case all TOF bins 
% are summed together). In the future,  this will allow TOF mashing.
%% MISCELLANEOUS PROPERTIES
% *Name (name)* = Name of the experiment/simulation/whatever (char). Used for 
% naming purposes.
% 
% *Precompute necessary data (precompute)* = If this is true, then some of the 
% obligatory mat-files are computed that are required if the |options.precompute_lor| 
% is set to true. Otherwise, there is no need to pass the precomputation step. 
% All mat-files are saved in the |mat-files| folder.
% 
% *Path to the input data (fpath)* = This is the path to the folder where the 
% input data is (char). All the files for the specified GATE output will be read. 
% E.g. if you set use_ASCII to true, then from the folder specified by fpath, 
% all the .dat files with Coincidences in them will be loaded, for LMF all .ccs 
% files will be loaded and for Root all .root files will be loaded. If you use 
% Windows, use the |fpat| value after |ispc|, otherwise the one after |else|.
% 
% *Form only sinograms (only_sinos)* = If this is set to true, then running 
% the m-file only performs steps up to the sinogram formation. I.e. data is loaded 
% and then the sinogram is formed. No reconstructions, normalization coefficient 
% computations or precomputations will be done.
% 
% *No input data load (no_data_load)* = If set to true, then all other sections/phases 
% are run normally except for the data load which is NOT performed.
% 
% *Precompute the observation/system matrix (precompute_obs_matrix)* = Experimental 
% feature. Setting to true computes the entire system matrix on one go and will 
% most likely require a significant amount of memory (most likely over 100 GB). 
% Supports only MLEM reconstruction. If set to false, then the system matrix is 
% calculated on-the-fly (recommended).
% 
% *Only reconstructions (only_reconstruction)* = Setting to true skips all other 
% steps except the reconstruction phase. Precompute step is also skipped even 
% if set to true. All necessary data is loaded from the previously computed mat-files. 
% This step also overwrites |only_sinos|.
% 
% *Use raw data (use_raw_data)* = Set this to true if you want to use raw list-mode 
% data. I.e. data that has not been compressed at all. This step requires its 
% own precompute phase if |options.precompute_lor = true|. The raw data in OMEGA 
% is formatted such that the saved measurement data is a vector formed from a 
% lower triangular matrix. This lower triangular matrix is extracted from a matrix 
% of size |total_number_of_detectors x total_number_of_detectors|. The matrix 
% contains all the possible line of response combinations, e.g. between detector 
% 1 and detector 3. Since the LOR between detectors 1 and 3 is the same as the 
% LOR between detectors 3 and 1, the upper triangular part is added to the lower 
% triangular part before the lower triangular part is extracted. The raw date 
% is always saved in cell format, regardless of the number of time steps. Non-cell 
% data should work, but cell data is recommended.
% 
% *How many pixels a LOR traverses (precompute_lor)* = When true, this option 
% changes the reconstruction process quite radically. First, it requires its own 
% precompute phase. Secondly, it affects greatly on how the system matrix is formed. 
% With this option set to true, the number of pixels each LOR traverses is determined 
% beforehand. For implementation 1 this allows for more efficient memory management, 
% while with other methods the computational speed is enhanced (more for raw data). 
% This step is HIGHLY recommended if you use implementation 1. Improved Siddon’s 
% algorithm with more than 1 ray is not supported when this is true.
% 
% *Precompute everything (precompute_all)* = This option causes the prepass 
% phase to compute all mat-files even if they were not selected. E.g. if you use 
% sinogram data, also all precomputations for raw list-mode data are done.
% 
% *Status messages (verbose)* = If this is set to true, then you will receive 
% occasional status messages and also elapsed time of functions.
%% RECONSTRUCTION PROPERTIES
% *IMPLEMENTATIONS*
% In OMEGA the different ways to compute the different algorithms and projections 
% are referred to as implementations.
% 
% *Implementation *= This option determines how the reconstructions and the 
% system matrix are computed. In all cases the system matrix is computed through 
% a mex-file (implementation 1 does have fallback non-mex system matrix formation 
% method, but that is very slow).
% 
% If set to 1, then all the reconstructions will be done purely in MATLAB using 
% nothing but MATLAB commands. Implementation 1 also supports all algorithms available. 
% The system matrix is formed as an actual matrix in a mex-file and then output 
% to MATLAB (when |precompute_lor = true|) or as sparse matrix indices (|precompute_lor 
% = false|) which are used to form the sparse matrix itself. The latter option 
% is NOT parallel and uses also more memory.
% 
% Implementation 2 is an OpenCL/ArrayFire reconstruction, and everything is 
% done in a mex-file. This is a matrix-free method. In Implementation 2 both the 
% system matrix creation and reconstruction are performed on the selected device. 
% Supports all the same algorithms as implementation 1. AD-MRP prior behaves differently 
% from implementation 1.
% 
% Implementation 3 uses pure OpenCL, i.e. doe not require ArrayFire libraries. 
% This is a matrix-free method. Implementation 3, however, only supports OSEM 
% and MLEM. Unlike implementation 2, implementation 3 does support multi-device 
% computation. The multi-device computation consists using of multiple GPUs (from 
% the same manufacturer) or using GPU + CPU combination (from the same manufacturer).
% 
% If set to 4, then all the computations are done parallel on the CPU by using 
% OpenMP (if supported by the compiler). This is a matrix-free method. This implementation 
% does not require OpenCL and should work on all CPUs. All CPUs/cores are used 
% automatically. All algorithms except MRAMLA and MBSREM are supported. All priors 
% are supported. Only one MLEM-based algorithm and one OS-based algorithm are 
% supported (with one prior) at a time. E.g. you can have MLEM and OSL-OSEM with 
% NLM, but not OSEM and OSL-OSEM.
% 
% In Implementations 2 and 3, the system matrix is created by using single precision 
% numbers, meaning that it can be slightly inaccurate when compared to Implementations 
% 1 and 4 that use double precision numbers.
% 
% On which implementation to select, see <useful_information.html Recommendations>.
% 
% *Device (use_device)* = This determines the device used in implementation 
% 2 and the platform in 3. For implementation 2 the devices mean the actual devices 
% available that are either CPUs, GPUs or accelerators, with GPUs usually being 
% first in the list (0 should use always use your GPU if you have one). Use |ArrayFire_OpenCL_device_info()| 
% to determine the devices you have and their respective number. For implementation 
% 3, the platforms are divided by manufacturer. Same manufacturer can have multiple 
% platforms, however, if you have multiple OpenCL runtimes installed. Use |OpenCL_device_info()| 
% to see the available platforms and the devices included in each of them. In 
% implementation 3, by default, all the devices associated with certain platform 
% are used except devices that have less than 2 GB of memory. Single device can 
% also be selected with the |options.cpu_to_gpu_factor| (see below).
% 
% *64 bit atomics (use_64bit_atomics)* = If true, then 64-bit atomic functions 
% are used. This affects ONLY implementations 2 and 3. If your device does not 
% support 64-bit atomics, the result will be equivalent to setting this to false 
% (with slightly slower overall computations due to extra compilation). Intel 
% hardware usually do not support 64-bit atomics, but AMD or Nvidia GPUs should. 
% Setting this to false will cause slower computations if the 64-bit atomics are 
% supported but can be slightly more reliable and accurate. This is recommended 
% when using GPUs and OpenCL.
% 
% *Use CUDA* = If true, uses CUDA code for implementation 2 instead of OpenCL. 
% This affects implementation 2 ONLY. Running |install_mex| will automatically 
% try to compile the CUDA code, but the CUDA kernels themselves are compiled at 
% runtime (with nvrtc). Currently this is recommended only when using the improved 
% Siddon as the projector. Orthogonal or volume-based ray tracer will most likely 
% be slower than when using OpenCL code.
% 
% *CPU to GPU factor (cpu_to_gpu_factor)* = Affects only implementation 3. This 
% variable has dual purpose. The first purpose is in heterogeneous computing by 
% delegating more LORs to the GPU part. E.g. if this is set to 2, then the GPU 
% will have 2x more LORs compared to the CPU. Another use is obtained by setting 
% this to 0, when it will use only a single device from the platform. GPUs are 
% prioritized with the GPU having the most memory chosen as the used device.
% *PROJECTOR*
% *Projector used (projector_type)* = Three different projectors are available 
% for all implementations. These are the improved Siddon’s algorithm (1), orthogonal 
% distance-based ray tracer (2) and volume-of-intersection based ray tracer (3). 
% Implementation 1, when |options.precompute_lor = false| also has the original 
% Siddon’s ray tracer (0). Orthogonal ray tracer allows for both 2.5D or 3D modes 
% (see below). For some additional help on selecting the projector see <useful_information.html 
% Recommendations>. 
% 
% *Use PSF* = Setting this to true will apply point spread function to the reconstruction. 
% This is equivalent to applying an image blurring matrix to the system matrix 
% computation.
% 
% *FWHM of the PSF (FWHM) *= This specifies the full width at half maximum (FWHM) 
% of the Gaussian blurring used in PSF. Separate values are available for all 
% three different dimensions (x, y and z).
% 
% *Use deblurring in PSF (use_deblurring)* = This performs convolution deblurring 
% to the PSF reconstruction AFTER the image reconstruction has fully completed. 
% This is performed for all iterations. The number of iterations for the deblurring 
% is the same as the number of subsets times the number of iterations.
% 
% *Strip width (tube_width_xy)* = Affects only orthogonal distance-based ray 
% tracer. This is the maximum distance from the ray to a voxel center allowed 
% in the projector in 2D (x- and y-directions). I.e. the width of the strip of 
% response. If the below value is zero, then this value is used and the orthogonal 
% ray tracer will be run in 2.5D mode. If the below value is non-zero then this 
% value is ignored.
% 
% *Tube width (tube_width_z)* = Affects only orthogonal distance-based ray tracer. 
% This is the maximum distance from the ray to a voxel center allowed in the projector 
% in 3D (x-, y- and z-directions). I.e. the width and height of the tube of response. 
% Only square tubes are allowed; if this is non-zero, any value in |tube_width_xy| 
% is ignored.
% 
% *Tube radius* = Affects only volume-of-intersection based ray tracer. This 
% is the radius of the tube of response, which is a cylinder in this case.
% 
% *Voxel radius* = Affects only volume-of-intersection based ray tracer. Relative 
% voxel radius of the spherical voxels used in the projector 3. If 1, then the 
% spherical voxel will be just large enough to completely contain the original 
% voxel. Lower values cause smaller voxels while larger values give larges ones.
% 
% *Number of transaxial rays (n_rays_transaxial)* = Affects only improved Siddon’s 
% algorithm when |options.precompute_lor = false| and using any implementation 
% other than 1 (i.e. works with implementations 2, 3 and 4). This is the number 
% of rays used in the improved Siddon in the transaxial dimension. Any number 
% of rays can be used. The total number of rays is |n_rays_axial| * |n_rays_transaxial|.
% 
% *Number of axial rays (n_rays_axial)* = Affects only improved Siddon’s algorithm 
% when |options.precompute_lor = false| and using any implementation other than 
% 1 (i.e. works with implementations 2, 3 and 4). This is the number of rays used 
% in the improved Siddon in the axial dimension. Any number of rays can be used. 
% The total number of rays is |n_rays_axial| * |n_rays_transaxial|.
% 
% *Accelerate reconstruction (apply_acceleration)* = Affects only orthogonal 
% distance-based and volume ray tracers with implementations 2 and 3. If set to 
% true, intermediate values are stored in memory. This accelerates the computations 
% by about 30%, but will lead to increased memory cost on GPUs. Can also cause 
% CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY errors.
% *RECONSTRUCTION SETTINGS*
% *Number of iterations (Niter)* = The number of iterations.
% 
% *Number of subsets (subsets)* = In subset methods, this value determines the 
% number of subsets that the sinogram/raw data is divided into. Depending on the 
% data type used (sinogram or raw), there are several different ways to select 
% the subsets (see below |subset_type|).
% 
% *Type of subset division (subset_type)* = Six different methods, numbered 
% from 1 to 6, to sort the measurements into subsets.
% 
% 1 = Every nth column is taken in order (sinogram only), e.g. once the end 
% of the column is reached, indexing starts from the first column again in the 
% next row.
% 
% 2 = Every nth row (both sinogram and raw data, default in raw data), once 
% the end of the row is reached, indexing starts from the first row again in the 
% next column.
% 
% 3 = The measurements are taken randomly, by default uses |randperm|, but can 
% use the file exchange |Shuffle| (see below) for faster speed and better memory 
% use.
% 
% 4 = Every nth column from the sinogram, takes an entire column and then jumps 
% n columns to the next.
% 
% 5 = Every nth row from the sinogram, takes an entire row and then jumps n 
% row to the next.
% 
% 6 = Uses n number of angles to form each subset. First the LORs are sorted 
% according to the angle they create with the (positive) x-axis. Then |n_angles| 
% (see below) angles are grouped together to form one subset. E.g. if |n_angles 
% = 2| then angles 0 and 1 form one subset, 2 and 3 another, etc. For 2D slices 
% there will be a total of 180°/nangles subsets and 360°/nangles for 3D. This 
% method is explained in <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references 
% [4>].
% 
% 7 = Uses golden angle sampling to select the subsets. Each sinogram uses the 
% same number of angles and the same angles, the golden angle sampling is thus 
% performed on single sinogram basis. The next angle is selected such that the 
% difference is roughly the same as the golden angle (approx. 111.246°). Currently 
% this subset sampling is supported only by sinogram data.
% 
% *Number of angles (n_angles)* = If the above method 6 is selected, this value 
% is used to determine how many angles are used in one subset.
% 
% *Initial value (x0)* = The initial value of all of the reconstruction methods. 
% In dynamic studies all the time steps have the same initial value.
% 
% *Epsilon value (epps)* = This small value is added to divisions to prevent 
% division by zero.
% *MISC SETTINGS*
% *Use Shuffle (use_Shuffle)* = Whether the MATLAB file exchange code <https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27076-shuffle 
% Shuffle> is used. Applies only to |subset_type = 3|. Speeds up the pre-process 
% a bit and also uses less memory.
% 
% *Use FSparse (use_fsparse)* = Whether <https://github.com/stefanengblom/stenglib 
% FSparse> is used. Only used if precompute_lor is set to false. Suggested only 
% for MATLAB 2019b and earlier.
% 
% *MRP-type prior without normalization (med_no_norm)* = Normally MPR-type priors 
% (MRP, FMH, L-filter, AD and weighted mean) are of the form (λ - Mb)/Mb. If this 
% is set to true, then the denominator (normalization) is removed (i.e. (λ - Mb)/1).
% *RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHMS*
% *Use MLEM/OSEM/etc.* = When any of these are set to true, the specific algorithm 
% is computed. This is dependent on the selected implementation. Separate sections 
% are for the maximum likelihood-based methods, maximum a posteriori methods and 
% priors. MAP methods require at least one prior and priors require at least one 
% MAP method.
% 
% *ACOSEM properties* = Only the acceleration factor can be adjusted. See the 
% original article for details.
% 
% *MRAMLA/MBSREM properties* = Relaxation parameter and the upper bound can 
% be adjusted.
% 
% *RAMLA/BSREM properties* = Relaxation parameter can be adjusted.
% 
% *ROSEM properties* = Relaxation parameter can be adjusted.
% 
% *DRAMA properties* = Parameters α, β and β0 can be adjusted. See [4], e.g. 
% eq. (20).
% 
% *Neighborhood properties* = Adjust how many neighboring voxels are taken into 
% account (|Ndx|, |Ndy| and |Ndz|). Used in MRP, quadratic prior, FMH, L-filter, 
% weighted mean and NLM.
% 
% *MRP properties* = Regularization parameters for all MAP-methods can be adjusted.
% 
% *Quadratic prior properties* = Regularization parameters for all MAP-methods 
% can be adjusted.
% 
% Custom weights can be input. The weights vector should be of size |(Ndx*2+1) 
% * (Ndy*2+1) * (Ndz*2+1)| and the middle value inf.
% 
% *L-filter properties* = Regularization parameters for all MAP-methods can 
% be adjusted.
% 
% Custom weights can be input. The weights vector should be of size |(Ndx*2+1) 
% * (Ndy*2+1) * (Ndz*2+1)| (middle value is NOT inf).
% 
% If custom weights are not given, the |options.oneD_weights| determines whether 
% 1D (true) or 2D (false) weighting scheme is used. In 1D case, if |(Ndx*2+1) 
% * (Ndy*2+1) * (Ndz*2+1)| = 3, = 9 or = 25 then the weights are exactly as in 
% literature <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references [5>]. 
% Otherwise the pattern follows a <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_distribution 
% Laplace distribution>. In 2D case, the weights follow Laplace distribution, 
% but are also weighted based on the distance of the neighboring voxel from the 
% center voxel. For Laplace distribution, the mean value is set to 0 and b = 1/sqrt(2). 
% The weights are normalized such that the sum equals 1.
% 
% *FMH properties* = Regularization parameters for all MAP-methods can be adjusted.
% 
% Custom weights can be input. The weights vector should be of size |[Ndx*2+1, 
% 4]| if |Nz = 1| or |Ndz = 0| or ´[Ndx*2+1, 13]´ otherwise. The weight for the 
% center pixel should also be the middle value when the weight matrix is in vector 
% form. The weights are normalized such that the sum equals 1.
% 
% If custom weights are not provided, then the |options.fmh_center_weight| parameter 
% is needed. Default value is 4 as in the original article <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references 
% [6>].
% 
% *Weighted mean properties* = Regularization parameters for all MAP-methods 
% can be adjusted.
% 
% Custom weights can be input. The weights vector should be of size |(Ndx*2+1) 
% * (Ndy*2+1) * (Ndz*2+1)|.
% 
% If custom weights are not provided, then the |options.weighted_center_weight| 
% parameter is needed. Default value is 4 as in the original article <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references 
% [6>]
% 
% *TV properties* = Regularization parameters for all MAP-methods can be adjusted.
% 
% |options.TVsmoothing| is a "smoothing" parameter that also prevents zero in 
% square root (it is summed to the square root values). (variable β in <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references 
% [7>] eq. 11 and <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references 
% [8>] eq. 13).
% 
% If |options.TV_use_anatomical = true|, then an anatomical prior is used in 
% TV regularization. |options.TV_reference_image| is the name of the file containing 
% the anatomical reference images (image size needs to be the same as the reconstructed 
% images). The reference images need to be the only variable in the file.
% 
% |options.TVtype| controls the type of TV regularization used. For |TVtype 
% = 1| see <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references [7>], 
% |TVtype = 2| <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references 
% [8>] and |TVtype = 3| <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references 
% [9>]. If no anatomical prior is used, then type 1 and 2 are the same. Type 3 
% uses the same weights as quadratic prior.
% 
% |options.T| is the edge threshold parameter in type 1 (variable C in <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references 
% [7>], see e.g. eq. 8), scale parameter for side information in type 2 (variable 
% γ in <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references [8>], see 
% eq. 13), weight parameter for anatomical information in type 2 (variable η in 
% <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references [9>], see eq. 
% 11).
% 
% |options.C| is the weight of the original image in type 3 (variable δ in <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references 
% [9>], see e.g. eq. 11).
% 
% All TV types are isotropic.
% 
% *MRP-AD properties* = In MRP-AD, the median filtered image is replaced with 
% anisotropic diffusion smoothed image. I.e. if MAD is the anisotropic diffusion 
% smoothed image, the prior is (λ - MAD)/MAD. Using this with implementation 1 
% requires the Image Processing Toolbox. This prior does not work on Octave.
% 
% Regularization parameters for all MAP-methods can be adjusted.
% 
% |options.TimeStepAD| is the time step for the AD filter (implementation 2 
% only). More information <http://arrayfire.org/docs/group__image__func__anisotropic__diffusion.htm 
% here>.
% 
% |options.KAD| is the conductivity/connectivity parameter. More information 
% <https://se.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imdiffusefilt.html here> and <http://arrayfire.org/docs/group__image__func__anisotropic__diffusion.htm 
% here>.
% 
% |options.NiterAD| number of iterations for the AD smoothing part.
% 
% |options.FluxType| is the flux/conduction type. Available methods are Exponential 
% (1) and Quadratic (2). E.g. |options.FluxType = 2| uses quadratic.
% 
% |options.DiffusionType| is the diffusion type (implementation 2 only). Available 
% methods are Gradient (1) and Modified curvature (2). E.g. |options.DiffusionType= 
% 2| uses modified curvature.
% 
% *APLS properties* = Using asymmetric parallel level sets requires the use 
% of anatomic prior. Without anatomical prior it functions as TV types 1 and 2.
% 
% Regularization parameters for all MAP-methods can be adjusted.
% 
% |options.eta| is a scaling parameter in regularized norm (see variable η in 
% <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references [8>]).
% 
% |options.APLSsmoothing| is a "smoothing" parameter that also prevents zero 
% in square root (it is summed to the square root values). Has the same function 
% as the |TVsmoothing| parameter (see <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references 
% [8>] eq. 9).
% 
% |options.APLS_reference_image| is the name of the file containing the anatomical 
% reference images (image size needs to be the same as the reconstructed images). 
% The reference images need to be the only variable in the file.
% 
% *TGV properties* = Regularization parameters for all MAP-methods can be adjusted.
% 
% |options.betaTGV| is the first weighting value for the TGV (see parameter 
% α1 in <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references [10>]).
% 
% |options.alphaTGV| is the second weighting value for the TGV (see parameter 
% α0 in <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references [10>]). 
% Weight for the symmetrized derivative.
% 
% |options.NiterTGV| number of iterations for the TGV smoothing part.
% 
% *NLM properties* = Regularization parameters for all MAP-methods can be adjusted.
% 
% |options.sigma| is the filtering parameter (see parameter h in <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references 
% [11>] or σ in <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/wiki/Function-help#references 
% [12>], eq. 6).
% 
% The patch radius is controlled with parameters |options.Nlx|, |options.Nly| 
% and |options.Nlz|. The similarity is investigated in this area.
% 
% The strength of the Gaussian weighting (standard deviation) of the weights 
% can be adjusted with |options.NLM_gauss|.
% 
% If |options.NLM_use_anatomical = true| then an anatomical reference image 
% is used in the similarity search of the neighborhood. Normally the original 
% image is used for this. |options.NLM_reference_image| is the name of the anatomical 
% reference data file. The reference images need to be the only variable in the 
% file.
% 
% If you wish to use non-local total variation, set |options.NLTV = true|. This 
% overwrites the MRP selection (see below). All other NLM options apply.
% 
% NLM can also be used like MRP (and MRP-AD) where the median filtered image 
% is replaced with NLM replaced image. This is achieved by setting |options.NLM_MRP 
% = true|. This is computed without normalization ((λ - MNLM)/1). All other NLM 
% options apply.
%% LOAD SCATTER DATA
% In this section, the user will be prompted to load the scatter correction 
% data if |options.scatter_correction = true|.
%% CUSTOM DETECTOR COORDINATES
% Here you can input custom detector coordinates. These enable the use of non-cylindrical 
% devices or continuous detectors (e.g. CPET in GATE). Transaxial coordinates 
% are specified as |options.x| and |options.y| while axial are |options.z| (or 
% alternatively |options.z_det|). Simply save your custom coordinates to the specified 
% |x|, |y| and |z| variables in the |options| struct. For sinogram data, the |x| 
% and |y| sizes should be |[sinogram_elements 2]| and |z| |[number_of_sinograms 
% 2]|. For raw data |[detectors_per_ring 1]| and| [number_of_rings 1]|, respectively. 
% 
% It is also possible to use pure event-by-event list-mode reconstruction with 
% custom coordinates. In this case each event should have its own detector coordinates 
% and as such each coordinate should be of size |[total_events 2]|. Currently 
% only implementation 4 supports event-by-event reconstruction and it is also 
% ONLY supported with custom detectors.
%% DEPTH OF INTERACTION
% This section is commented by default, but can be used to specify a  depth 
% of interaction value (millimeters). By default this is set to 0,  i.e. it is 
% assumed that all the interactions occur at the surface of the detector crystals. 
% What this value changes is the depth of where the  interactions are assumed 
% to occur, i.e. it only changes the detector  coordinates such that the transaxial 
% coordinates are "deeper" in the  crystal. Having too large values can cause 
% issues with the  reconstruction.
% 
% This value does not affect custom detector coordinates.
