%% Getting started
% OMEGA is a software for MATLAB and Octave to reconstruct data obtained with 
% a positron emission tomography device. This software also allows to easily reconstruct 
% ASCII, LMF or ROOT data obtained from <http://www.opengatecollaboration.org/ 
% GATE> simulations. See Features section below for more information on available 
% features and Known Issues and Limitations for software limitations. If you wish 
% to add your own code (e.g. reconstruction algorithm) see <contributing.html 
% Contributing code to OMEGA>.
% General information
% Most OMEGA features are built around m-file scripts referred to as "main-files". 
% In these main files, a struct variable, called |options|, is filled and contains 
% all the parameters that are needed for any of  the operations selected. PET 
% and CT have quite different main-file  compositions due to different properties 
% of these imaging modalities.  CT, for example, has much less adjustable parameters 
% due to lack of  corrections. Reconstruction parameters, however, are unchanged 
% between  different modalities. It is not necessary to use these main-files and  
% not every variable present in the main-files is necessary. Many of the  included 
% functions can be used without the |options| struct,  but some core functions, 
% such as loading GATE data, require its use. In  MATLAB you can run individual 
% section easily when using the GUI, but in  Octave you will need to run the entire 
% m-file or select the required  text to be run (due to the large size of the 
% m-files, this is not  recommended). Due to this, there are parameters that allow 
% only the load of PET data (|options.only_sinos|) when the file is run, or only 
% performing the image reconstruction (|options.only_reconstructions|).
% 
% Most of the functions included are simple m-files, however, some of  the more 
% demanding work is done in MEX/OCT-files. These include, for  example, sinogram 
% creation and image reconstruction/system matrix  creation.
