%% Using GATE CT data
% The example script <https://github.com/villekf/OMEGA/blob/master/gate_CT_main.m 
% |gate_CT_main.m|> is an example on how to use CT projection data collected with 
% GATE.  Currently ROOT data is not supported. The example is based on the <https://github.com/OpenGATE/GateContrib/tree/master/imaging/CT/classic 
% classic> CT example. The function |loadProjectionData| loads any binary projection 
% data and can be used to read all the binary files with the same file ending 
% in the specified folder (the user will  be prompted for the data). Simply select 
% any projection data file and  all the other projections will be automatically 
% loaded. |loadProjectionData| can also save the projection data to a MATLAB/Octave 
% mat-file, though that is not enabled by default.
% 
% Other than the data load, there are no differences between using GATE data 
% to that of any other projection data. In the future, when ROOT  data support 
% is added, similar scatter extraction features, as with PET  data, will most 
% likely be added.
