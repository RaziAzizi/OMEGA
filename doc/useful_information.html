%% Useful information
% This page lists some useful information such as recommendations and possible 
% issues that can arise.
%% Recommendations
%% Importing GATE data
% On Unix systems, it is highly recommended to use ROOT data as it takes less 
% disk space than ASCII or LMF but is also faster to load than ASCII and has more 
% features than LMF. However, do take note of the crashing in MATLAB R2018b and 
% earlier (see the README.md).
% 
% On Windows systems ASCII is the recommended format.
% 
% LMF format is not recommended but can be used for normal coincidence imaging 
% (i.e. no trues or scatter extraction).
%% Using corrections
% When using randoms correction (delayed coincidence window), variance  reduction 
% is recommended when performing the corrections during the  image reconstruction.
% 
% Corrections during the reconstruction are recommended to preserve the Poisson 
% nature of the measurement data, however, they will most likely  slightly reduce 
% the speed of the image reconstruction. This should be only marginal increase 
% though.
% 
% Normalization with raw list-mode data can be unreliable compared to sinogram 
% data. Computing normalization coefficients for raw data also uses more memory. 
% Nevertheless, it is highly recommended to perform normalization coefficient 
% computation to raw data if possible.
%% Selecting the correct implementation
% Implementation 2 is the recommended method if it is supported and if single 
% precision (f32) variables are not a problem. It should be both the fastest method 
% and also, along with implementation 1, has the widest array of supported features. 
% For CUDA capable devices, it is recommended to enable CUDA if you are using 
% improved Siddon (i.e. |projector_type = 1|) otherwise OpenCL is recommended.
% 
% Implementation 3 is recommended if you have multiple GPUs and want to compute 
% OSEM/MLEM reconstructions. For single GPU/device case it is recommended to use 
% implementation 2 instead if possible. Implementation 3 is recommended over implementation 
% 4, though the latter (4) uses double precision numbers while the former (3) 
% uses single precision. If you are doing OSEM or MLEM only and want the simplest 
% and fast method, then implementation 3 is recommended. Implementation 3 is also 
% recommended if you can't use implementation 2 (e.g. using MinGW on Windows), 
% but want to utilize GPU(s).
% 
% Implementation 4 is recommended when implementation 2 is not available and 
% you need more than OSEM and/or MLEM, or, alternatively, if you are not interested 
% or capable of installing the required OpenCL/ArrayFire files.
% 
% Implementation 1 should only be used if none of the above cases are valid. 
% This could be if you want to use some of the other algorithms (e.g. MBSREM), 
% but can't use implementation 2, or if you want to compute the system matrix. 
% Note, however, that there are memory considerations when using implementation 
% 1 (see below memory issues).
%% Selecting the projector
% For best quality, the recommended projector is the volume of intersection 
% ray tracer, i.e. |options.projector_type = 3|. Default tube and voxel radius 
% values are recommended. However, this is also the slowest method. Orthogonal 
% distance-based ray tracer is slightly faster alternative with 2.5D mode being 
% even faster.
% 
% If you want a compromise between speed and quality, then point spread function 
% (PSF) reconstruction (i.e. |options.use_psf = true|) with improved Siddon is 
% recommended. Improved Siddon with PSF is several times faster than orthogonal 
% or volume-based ray tracers.
% 
% For pure speed, improved Siddon without PSF is recommended. This, however, 
% can lead to aliasing artifacts in some cases.
%% Image reconstruction parameters
% For best quality, the recommended projector is the orthogonal distance-based 
% ray tracer in 3D mode. |options.tube_width_z| is recommended to be the FWHM 
% or, alternatively, the approximately size of the crystal pitch. However, this 
% is also the slowest method.
% 
% For the number of iterations, subsets, subset type, regularization  parameters, 
% etc. I canâ€™t give any recommendations. The optimal  selections and values depend 
% on the use case and as such it is best to  either experiment or follow values 
% in literature.
%% Memory and computational issues
%% Data load
% Large scanners can require quite significant amount of memory when loading 
% the GATE/list-mode data. For example, the Biograph mCT or Vision scanners can 
% use over 20 GB of memory. As such, it is recommended to have at least 24 GB 
% of memory when loading data from larger scanners, though with sufficient swap 
% file size less should be sufficient though it can have significant impact on 
% speed.
%% Dynamic imaging
% Dynamic imaging can be very memory intensive if you have a large  amount of 
% time steps. Furthermore, dynamic data load and sinogram  formation can take 
% over an hour depending on the amount of time steps,  the scanner used and the 
% computer the computations are performed on.
% 
% Saving the dynamic examination sinogram data might also fail in Octave due 
% to the lack of support for v. 7.3 type of MAT-files.
%% TOF
% Using TOF data not only requires more memory, but also takes more  disk space 
% when saving the measurement data. While there is no upper  limit to the number 
% of TOF bins, it is recommended to keep the bin count in less than 100. Dynamic 
% TOF sinograms require even more space and  memory. However, dynamic sinograms 
% do not need extra memory when using  GPU as the subsequent time frames are saved 
% in the system memory.
%% Image reconstruction
% Implementation 1 is very memory intensive method since it is not a matrix-free 
% method. This is especially true if |options.precompute_lor = false| (this is 
% also the only case where the system matrix computations are NOT done in parallel). 
% Some algorithms with implementation 1 can require much more memory. These include 
% at least MBSREM/MRAMLA. Minimum of 16GB of memory is recommended if using these, 
% but even that might be too little depending on the subset and image size.
% 
% Due to above, only improved Siddon's algorithm is recommended as the projector. 
% Especially 3D orthogonal distance-based or volume-based ray tracers can take 
% significant amount of memory.
% 
% On large neighborhoods MRP, FMH and L-filter can use significant amounts of 
% memory. It is recommended to keep the neighborhood smaller than 9x9x9. In the 
% case of MRP, however, this applies only if you do not have image processing 
% toolbox.
% 
% As already mentioned above, using implementation 1 with |options.precompute_lor 
% = false| is simply NOT recommended. This is only supported in order to keep 
% feature parity (and because it was the first version that was implemented).
% 
% Using the precomputed system matrix (i.e. |options.precompute_obs_matrix = 
% true|) (implementation 1 only) can take over 100GB of memory on normal PET scanners. 
% Due to this, it has not been tested and is not recommended for 3D reconstruction.
% 
% Errors in MEX-files with implementations 2 and 3 will currently create memory 
% leaks. Closing MATLAB/Octave will clear the allocated memory from the device. 
% It is also possible that errors will cause these methods to become unusable 
% until the software is restarted.
