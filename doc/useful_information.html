%% Useful information
% This page lists some useful information such as recommendations and possible 
% issues that can arise.
%% Recommendations
%% Importing GATE data
% On Unix systems, it is highly recommended to use ROOT data as it  takes less 
% disk space than ASCII or LMF but is also faster to load than  ASCII and has 
% more features than LMF. However, do take note of the  crashing in MATLAB R2018b 
% and earlier (see the README.md).
% 
% On Windows systems ASCII is the recommended format.
% 
% LMF format is not recommended but can be used for normal coincidence imaging 
% (i.e. no trues or scatter extraction).
%% Using corrections
% When using randoms correction (delayed coincidence window), variance  reduction 
% is recommended when performing the corrections during the  image reconstruction.
% 
% Corrections during the reconstruction are recommended to preserve the Poisson 
% nature of the measurement data, however, they will most likely  slightly reduce 
% the speed of the image reconstruction. This should be  only marginal increase 
% though.
% 
% Normalization with raw list-mode data can be unreliable compared to  sinogram 
% data. Computing normalization coefficients for raw data also  uses more memory.
%% Selecting the correct implementation
% Implementation 2 is the recommended method if it is supported (e.g.  it is 
% not possible to use in Octave on Windows) and if single precision  (f32) variables 
% are not a problem.
% 
% For pure OSEM/MLEM reconstructions, implementation 4 is recommended  and should 
% work on all platforms as long as C++11 compiler is available. Implementation 
% 4 also uses double precision (f64) variables and works  purely on the CPU. For 
% NLM, implementation 4 is recommended.
% 
% Implementation 3 is recommended if you have multiple GPUs and want to compute 
% OSEM/MLEM reconstructions. It is also most likely faster than  implementation 
% 2 when doing OSEM or MLEM reconstructions only.
% 
% If you are doing OSEM or MLEM only and want the fastest method, then implementation 
% 3 is recommended.
% 
% Implementation 1 should only be used if none of the above cases are  valid. 
% This could be if you want to use some of the other algorithms  (e.g. COSEM), 
% but can’t use implementation 2, or if you want to compute  the system matrix. 
% Note, however, that there are memory considerations  when using implementation 
% 1 (see below memory issues).
%% Image reconstruction parameters
% For best quality, the recommended projector is the orthogonal distance-based 
% ray tracer in 3D mode. |options.tube_width_z| is recommended to be the FWHM 
% or, alternatively, the approximately size of the crystal pitch. However, this 
% is also the slowest method.
% 
% For the number of iterations, subsets, subset type, regularization  parameters, 
% etc. I can’t give any recommendations. The optimal  selections and values depend 
% on the use case and as such it is best to  either experiment or follow values 
% in literature.
%% Memory and computational issues
%% Dynamic imaging
% Dynamic imaging can be very memory intensive if you have a large  amount of 
% time steps. Furthermore, dynamic data load and sinogram  formation can take 
% over an hour depending on the amount of time steps,  the machine used and the 
% computer the computations are performed on.
% 
% Saving the dynamic examination sinogram data might also fail in Octave due 
% to the lack of support for v. 7.3 type of MAT-files.
%% Image reconstruction
% Implementation 1 is very memory intensive method as it is not a matrix-free 
% method. This is especially true if |options.precompute_lor = false| (this is 
% also the only case where the system matrix computations are  NOT parallel). 
% Several algorithms with implementation 1 can require much more memory. These 
% include at least all COSEM variations and  MBSREM/MRAMLA. Minimum of 16GB of 
% memory is recommended if using these,  but even that might be too little depending 
% on the subset and image  size.
% 
% Due to above, only improved Siddon’s algorithm is recommended as the  projector. 
% Especially 3D orthogonal distance-based ray tracer can take  significant amount 
% of memory.
% 
% NLM is currently very memory intensive prior, regardless of the implementation.
% 
% As already mentioned above, using implementation 1 with |options.precompute_lor 
% = false| is simply NOT recommended. This is only supported in order to keep  
% feature parity (and because it was the first version that was  implemented).
% 
% Using the precomputed system matrix (i.e. |options.precompute_obs_matrix = 
% true|) (implementation 1 only) can take over 100GB of memory on normal PET  
% machines. Due to this, it has not been tested and is not recommended for 3D 
% reconstruction.
% 
% Errors in MEX-files with implementations 2 and 3 will currently  create memory 
% leaks. Closing MATLAB/Octave will clear the allocated  memory from the device.
